AB  - OBJECTIVE: To look into effective use of popular Internet site YouTube as an 
      information source on kidney stone disease. Urolithiasis is among the most common 
      urological conditions, accounting for significant morbidity, however adequate 
      education regarding simple lifestyle modifications and early recognition of symptoms 
      can reduce recurrence and visits to emergency department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      YouTube was searched using Keywords "nephrolithiasis"; "renal calculi"; "renal 
      stones"; and "kidney stones" for videos uploaded containing relevant information 
      about the disease. Only videos in English were included. Two physician viewers 
      watched each video and classified them as useful; misleading; or personal 
      experiences. The kappa-statistic was used to measure inter-observer variability. 
      Total-viewership; duration; rating; days since upload; source; and information 
      content were noted RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-nine videos had relevant information 
      about nephrolithiasis; 58.3% of the videos had useful information and 18.1% were 
      misleading. Useful videos had 47.2% of total viewership (i.e. total no. of views) 
      share, whereas misleading videos had 2.8%, with statistically significant difference 
      in viewership/day and rating among useful videos vs misleading videos. 
      Universities'channel videos provided the best overall information coverage among the 
      useful videos (prevention = 100%, symptoms = 80%, treatments = 60%, other 
      information = 80%). No significant difference was seen in viewership/day or rating 
      of useful videos based on the kind of information they contained. CONCLUSIONS: 
      YouTube has a substantial amount of information on urolithiasis. Therefore, 
      consumer-generated outlets such as YouTube have significant potential to sway 
      individuals' attitudes both for and against the right choice. In view of this, 
      authoritative videos by trusted sources should be posted for dissemination of 
      reliable information.
