In the last years, significant efforts have been devoted to differentiating pervasive transcription from functional Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcripts.

Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e.  , core and edge clouds, can help these applications\u2019 real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose. In this paper, we present a novel Artificial Intelligent (AI)-augmented geographic routing approach, that relies on an area knowledge obtained from the satellite imagery (available at the edge cloud) by applying deep learning. In particular, we propose a stateless greedy forwarding that uses such an environment learning to proactively avoid the local minimum problem by diverting traffic with an algorithm that emulates electrostatic repulsive forces. In our theoretical analysis, we show that our Greedy Forwarding achieves in the worst case a 3.291 path stretch approximation bound with respect to the shortest path, without assuming presence of symmetrical links or unit disk graphs. We evaluate our approach with both numerical and event-driven simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate improvement of application level throughput due to a reduced path stretch under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios.", "channelId":

biological function. \n\nExamples are numerous: disproportionate numbers of spermatozoa during fertilization compared to one egg, large number of neurotransmitters released during neuronal communication compared to the number of receptors, large numbers of released calcium ions during transient in cells and many more in molecular and cellular transduction or gene activation and cell signaling. \n\n\n\nThis redundancy is particularly relevant when the sites of activation is physically separated from the initial position of the molecular messengers.  The redundancy is often generated for the purpose of resolving the time constraint of fast-activating pathways. \n\n\n\nLarge numbers should not be considered wasteful, but are necessary for generating the fastest possible response and make possible rare events that otherwise would never happen. This property is universal, ranging from the molecular scale to the population level. \n\n\n\nD. Holcman\n\n\n[1] Schuss, Z., Basnayake, K., & Holcman, D. (2019).
