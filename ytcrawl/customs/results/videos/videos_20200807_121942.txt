Georgina Flesia (FAMAF - UNC - CONICET)\n\nResumen: La reducci\u00f3n de dimensionalidad (DR) se aplica con frecuencia durante el an\u00e1lisis de datos con gran dimensi\u00f3n. Es un  medio de eliminaci\u00f3n de ruido y simplificaci\u00f3n y puede ser beneficioso para la mayor\u00eda de los conjuntos de datos biol\u00f3gicos modernos, en los que no es raro tener cientos o incluso millones de mediciones simult\u00e1neas recolectadas para una sola muestra. Debido a \"la maldici\u00f3n de la dimensionalidad\", muchos m\u00e9todos estad\u00edsticos carecen de potencia cuando se aplican a datos de alta dimensi\u00f3n. Incluso si el n\u00famero de datos recopilados es grande, usualmente se encuentran  incrustados en un voluminoso  espacio de alta dimensi\u00f3n que es pr\u00e1cticamente imposible de explorar exhaustivamente. Esta charla  sigue la discusi\u00f3n de Nguyon-Holmes 2019 sobre el problema, y se  presenta un conjunto de pautas \u00fatiles para profesionales que especifican c\u00f3mo realizar DR correctamente, interpretar su salida y comunicar los resultados.\n\nFuente: Nguyen LH, Holmes S (2019) Ten quick tips for effective dimensionality reduction.

The educators studied some 350 5th grade students in 6 Baltimore schools.\n\nIn this crossover study design, one group of students received the arts-enriched science class and the other group the straight science curriculum.  In the second part of the investigation, the groups were reversed.\n\nThe data demonstrated that the art-science combo lessons covering chemistry-environmental science and life science-astronomy were retained three times better than straight science instruction by those students at a basic reading level.  Those students with more advanced reading skills and academic performance derived no benefit.  I\u2019ll bet they did have more fun.\n\nBreathing life into potentially dry educational material on any subject is a winning strategy.  This study also suggests that the technique can help academically challenged students excel in potentially frustrating courses of study and love school a whole lot more.\n\n#science #arts #singing #dancing #rap #drawing #healthnews\n\nMariale M.

In doing so, we will explore clothing swaps, as well as other alternative markets, that function as an act of gradual social change, away from a capitalist economy and towards a socialist structure. Ideally, this video will educate individuals about the exploitative nature of a capitalist economy and provide them with the knowledge necessary to begin interrogating the ways in which we engage with the world.\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlbinsson, P.

Presently, there are 4 XAS beamlines (BL1.1, BL2.2, BL5.2 and BL8) covering a very wide photon energy range from 1 keV to 18 keV [1-2]. In this presentation, SLRI and the Siam Photon Source (SPS) will be introduced. The SPS is a 1.2 GeV synchrotron machine with 8 bending magnets and 4 insertion devices (an undulator, a multipole wiggler and 2 wavelength shifters). Stored electron beam lifetime is currently 11 h at 80-150 mA. The BL1.1 uses hard X-rays from the 2.2T multipole wiggler, the others use tender X-rays from the 1.44T bending magnets. The XAS beamlines and their capability will be discussed in detail. Among other synchrotron-based techniques at SLRI, XAS is the most popular and productive in terms of number of users' experiments (more than 100/year) and number of users' publications (more than 60/year). Experiments can be done in transmission, fluorescence-yield and electron-yield modes. Additionally, in situ measurements are possible. To demonstrate XAS capability at SLRI, highlighted research in various fields will be presented, i.e. Fe site determination on a grafted Zr-based MOF catalyst [3],  monitoring dynamic phase transition of olivine as a Li-ion battery cathode [4], phosphorous and sulfur speciation in soils [5] and determination on oxidation states to identify coloring elements in Thai ancient glasses [6-7].  \nReading: \n[1] W.

Developmental specialists and neuroscientists there studied some 470 preschoolers and their parents using electronic sleep monitoring and questionnaires for behavioral assessment.\n\nThirty-four percent of the kids had TVs in their bedrooms, and those children slept 17 fewer minutes per 24 hours than those without bedroom TVs.  They tended to require longer daytime naps and spent an average of 12 minutes more asleep during the day.\n\nTV viewing during the day also had effects on sleep patterns.  The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend limiting TV viewing for 2 to 4 year olds to one hour of high quality, educational programming a day, and the viewing should occur with a parent if possible.  \n\nThe study showed that only 46% of kids had viewing habits that met these guidelines. Those children whose daily TV screen time did meet guidelines and amounted to less than one hour a day were found to clock 22 more minutes of nighttime sleep.\n\nLike any other children\u2019s activity, screen time should be thoughtfully planned and carefully monitored.  As always, moderation is the best policy.\n\nAbigail F. Helm, Rebecca M.C. Spencer. Television use and its effects on sleep in early childhood.

The storage experiment was conducted in two seasons (2017\u20132018). The obtained results proved that the presence SA with biopolymers CS/PVA at 2mM increased antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activities. Therefore, it delayed the malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl group (PCG) accumulation and cell membrane leakage. Accompanying, it protected phenolic substances such as total phenol (TP) and flavonoid (FL) due to inhibited polyphenol oxidase (PPO), so less browning symptoms in rachis through cold storage. Also, the CS/PVA-SA 2mM decreased the accumulation of O2\u2022\u2212 and H2O2. These results suggested that the CS/PVP-SA 2mM coating treatments can be applied as a beneficial technique for increasing the storage ability of 'Thompson seedless' grapes by enhancing antioxidant system activity leading to higher membrane integrity showed by lower electrolyte leakage, MDA, and PCG content coincide with less browning symptoms in

A new study from Northwestern University cardiologists looks at CDC epidemiologic data for nearly 48 million Americans from 35 to 84 years of age.\n\nThe study shows that the trend toward declining death rates from heart failure seen over the past 3 decades is now reversing.  Younger individuals are now more likely to develop heart failure, and the reasons appear to be due to our country\u2019s dual interrelated epidemics of obesity and diabetes.  Middle-aged black men are at a particularly high risk.\n\nHeart failure is deadly with outcomes similar to metastatic lung cancer.  The best treatment is prevention by maintaining a healthy weight, keeping your blood pressure under control, and monitoring your cholesterol and lipid profiles.  These goals will be far easier to achieve by eliminating fast food and excessive alcohol.\n\nPeter Glynn, Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, Matthew J. Feinstein, Mercedes Carnethon, Sadiya S. Khan.

Neurophysiologists at the National Institutes of Health make this recommendation after analyzing the brain activity of volunteers as they master the task of reproducibly pressing a series of keys.\n\nThe scientists noted that brain wave activity which signals the cementing of behaviors into memory was more intense during short rest periods between skill practice sessions.  The subjects performed incrementally better when their initial mastery and practice sessions were interrupted by short rest periods compared with intense practice sessions followed by a night off and re-testing in the morning.\n\nSo, if you are trying to perfect a skill, learn it and practice it for awhile, then take a break, and the return to practice.  After several cycles, you should be able to optimize your performance and make it reproducible.\n\nMarlene B\u00f6nstrup, I\u00f1aki Iturrate, Ryan Thompson, Gabriel Cruciani, Nitzan Censor, Leonardo G.

This simple vlog on #professionisyourpassion aims to deliver to our lovies and all other viewers the importance of preparation and how to invest in yourself to be ready for the career path that one wants. Then maybe it will give hope to pursue their passion and also provide awareness since she is an advocate of animals at the same time the environment. If not possible, then at the very least to let them think about something good.\n\nIn a country like the Philippines we always encounter students routing for college courses which are typically not appropriate for us. Since we are embraced by oceans maybe knowledge, guidance or awareness must really be given to the young generations so they will also consider courses or a career like marine biology, oceanography or the likes. At the same time showing to our #lovies how #passion works in one\u2019s career. \n\nThere were 25 Questions raised that our interviewee answered making 14 years in service and a lifetime of learning all in one video. It may be long but compared to what she went through this 30 minutes interview is packed with nugget of thoughts and helpful tips hopefully may touch the heart or mind of those who would want to become a marine biologist themselves or those who struggle still on whether to pursue their very goal their passion or what is just there. \nLocation of interview: Residence in San Diego California\nPhoto Credits: Francesca Irene and Family\nPeople Mentioned: Vinh (Husband)\n\nFRANCESCA IRENE BATAC, MS\nAge: 37\n\nEducation https://www.metx.ucsc.edu/\n2000-2004 Bachelor of Science (Marine Biology) University of California, Santa Cruz\n2016-2018 Master of Science /MS (Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology) UCSC CA, US\n\nEmployment https://wildlife.ca.gov/OSPR/Science/MWVCRC\n2005-present California Department of Fish and Wildlife Santa Cruz, CA US\nLab Technician \u2013 Animal Pathology\nSea Otter Biologist\nOil Spill Rehabilitation\n\nAuthored Journals:\nPathology and epidemiology of nasopulmonary acariasis (Halarachne sp.) in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and wildlife URL is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2019.03.009 (one of the authors)\n\nSouthern Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris neresi) Population Biology at Big Sur and Monterey, California-investigating the consequences of resource abundance and anthropogenic stressors for sea otter recovery U.S. Geological Survey https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191022 (one of the authors)\n\nMycoplasma enhydrae sp.

His PhD research was carried out in partnership with Motek and Amsterdam University Medical Center, where these studies were carried out. \n\nFor more information, please see associated published articles:\n\n\"How normal is normal: consequences of stride to stride variability, treadmill walking and age when using normative paediatric gait data\"\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966636218311755\nDOI: 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.03.011\n\n\"Immediate effects of immersive biofeedback on gait in children with cerebral palsy\"\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003999318314497\nDOI: 10.1016/j.apmr.2018.10.013\n\n\"The efficacy of functional gait training in children and young adults with cerebral palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis\"\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dmcn.13708\nDOI: 10.1111/dmcn.13708\n\n\"Real-time feedback to improve gait in children with cerebral palsy\"\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966636216306506?via%3Dihub\nDOI: 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2016.11.021 \n\n#CerebralPalsy #Biofeedback #Virtual Reality", "publishedAt": "2019-08-05T10:58:00Z", "title": "Biofeedback to Improve Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy (Hosted)", "channelTitle": "Motek Medical"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.011"}, {"q": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.011", "items": [{"id": "auO5BtaPGg0", "statistics": {"dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "1", "viewCount": "380", "likeCount": "8", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M24S"}, "snippet": {"channelId": "UC6UuNrFE_l3eL9jLTOgngdQ", "tags": ["Biliary", "Bilateral stent", "Hilar biliary"], "description": "Dr Jong Ho Moon discusses his article, \"Prospective comparison of endoscopic bilateral stent-in-stent versus stent-by-stent deployment for inoperable advanced malignant hilar biliary stricture\" from the August issue.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2019.03.011", "publishedAt": "2019-07-22T21:59:57Z", "title": "2019 August Author Interview-Jong Ho Moon", "channelTitle": "GIE: Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Author Interviews"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.011"}, {"q": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.011", "items": [{"id": "qnX0RVCWP-I", "statistics": {"dislikeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "553", "likeCount": "3", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M1S"}, "snippet": {"channelId": "UCin0lnZJW9mHl1kq7kH0nZg", "tags": ["Endoclip", "Papilloplasty", "Patulous papilla"], "description": "In this video, Xue Fan, MM, et al, present a novel procedure called endoclip papilloplasty: zipper closure of the patulous papilla with endoclips.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vgie.2019.03.011", "publishedAt": "2019-07-01T15:46:16Z", "title": "Endoclip papilloplasty for a patulous and incompetent biliary papilla", "channelTitle": "VideoGIE Journal"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.011"}, {"q": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.013", "items": [{"id": "GMFdHjlyaVI", "statistics": {"dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "261", "likeCount": "6", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT7M"}, "snippet": {"channelId": "UCin0lnZJW9mHl1kq7kH0nZg", "tags": ["EUS", "FNA", "Cytopathology"], "description": "Rafael Romero-Castro, MD, PhD, et al, report on 2 cases of EUS-FNA of right atrial masses with the use of 25-gauge needles, with rapid on-site evaluation by a cytopathologist.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vgie.2019.03.013", "publishedAt": "2019-07-01T15:46:16Z", "title": "EUS-FNA of 2 right atrial masses", "channelTitle": "VideoGIE Journal"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.013"}, {"q": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.03.013", "items": [{"id": "9QyMVsuc9Ig", "statistics": {"dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "8", "likeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M19S"}, "snippet": {"channelId": "UCKPOSWu-b4GjEK_iOCsp4MA", "tags": ["Exercise", "circadianrhythm"], "description": "Exercising in the morning tones your muscles while exercising in the evening turbocharges your entire metabolism.

M. Viola et al. \"The leading-edge vortex of yacht sails\"\nhttp://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD17/Session/G18.10\n\nWe experimentally show, for the first time, that a stable Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) can be formed on an asymmetric spinnaker, which is a high-lift sail used by yachts to sail downwind. We tested a 3D printed rigid sail in a water flume at a chord-based Reynolds number of ca. 104. We found that on the leeward side of the sail (the suction side), the flow separates at the leading edge reattaching further downstream and forming a stable LEV. The LEV grows in diameter from the root to the tip of the sail, where it merges with the tip vortex. We detected the LEV using the \ud835\udefe criterion, and we verified its stability over time. The lift contribution provided by the LEV was computed solving a complex potential model of each sail section. This analysis indicated that the LEV provides a substantial contribution to the total sail's lift. These findings suggest that the maximum lift of low-aspect-ratio wings with a sharp leading edge, such as spinnakers, can be enhanced by promoting a stable LEV.\n\nPublication (Ocean Engineering): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.02.029\n\nSpecial Thanks To:\nNicole Sharp\nA.

Plastic cups can be used for storing most liquids, but hot liquids may melt or warp the material.\n\nEnvironmental issuesEdit\n\nFurther information:\u00a0Great Pacific garbage patch,\u00a0plastic waste, and\u00a0marine debris\n\nMost plastic cups are designed for\u00a0single uses\u00a0and then\u00a0disposal\u00a0or recycling.[1]\u00a0A\u00a0life cycle inventory\u00a0of a comparison of paper and plastic shows environmental effects of both with no clear winner.[2]\n\nProduction of 1 tonne (0.98 long tons; 1.1 short tons) of plastic cup emits 135 pounds (61\u00a0kg) of\u00a0green house gases.\n\nThe choice between\u00a0paper cups\u00a0and plastic cups has to do with the life of the item after use. A paper cup may\u00a0biodegrade\u00a0faster than a\u00a0Styrofoam cup\u00a0or a plastic cup. In general cardboard or paper takes one to three months for biodegradation, as the majority of the content, up to 95%, is made with wood chips. A plastic cup can take up to 90 years to biodegrade, depending on the type of plastic.\n\nPlastic cups are made with\u00a0oil, which is not a renewable source. On the other hand, paper cups can be sourced from forests which fall under\u00a0sustainable management.\n\nPlastic cups, especially those made with\u00a0polystyrene, are also a possible\u00a0health hazardas chemicals may leach into the beverage. This is more likely to happen with warm drinks (hot chocolate, tea and coffee) than with cold drinks.[\n\nReferencesEdit\n\n^\u00a0Schnurr, Riley E.J.; Alboiu, Vanessa; Chaudhary, Meenakshi; Corbett, Roan A.; Quanz, Meaghan E.; Sankar, Karthikeshwar; Srain, Harveer S.; Thavarajah, Venukasan; Xanthos, Dirk; Walker, Tony R.

Martina K\u00f6lbl-Ebert et al (2018), Current Biology https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.09.013\n\nPycnodontiformes are an extinct order of ray-finned fishes from the Triassic to Eocene, with a characteristic crushing dentition reflecting a highly specialized diet. However, our discovery of a new pycnodontiform from the Late Jurassic (ca. 152 Ma) Plattenkalk deposits of the Solnhofen Archipelago revealed long, pointed teeth along the vomer and triangular teeth with cutting edges along the prearticulars.\n\nThis is the earliest evidence of specialized flesh cutting in a ray-finned fish. The dentition pattern, tooth shape, jaw morphology, and mechanics are all indicative of a feeding apparatus suitable for slicing flesh or fins, thus pioneering a new ecological niche.\n\nEvidence suggests that it may have exploited aggressive mimicry in a striking parallel to the feeding patterns of modern piranha. Remarkably, fossil fishes recovered from the same deposits as the new pycnodontiform show injuries to fins and fin bases. As a marine piranha-like fish contemporary with dinosaurs, it is the oldest known flesh-eating actinopterygian, revealing remarkable convergent evolution with modern piranhas.\n\nGood channel: https://www.youtube.com/Dlium\nSubscribe, like and comment.\n\nGood website: https://www.dlium.com\nBookmark, subscribe and comment.", "publishedAt": "2018-10-19T21:33:57Z", "title": "A Piranha-like Pycnodontiform Fish from the Late Jurassic", "channelTitle": "ScienceVio"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.im.2018.09.013"}, {"q": "10.1016/j.im.2018.09.013", "items": [{"id": "3Q4F3apDbRk", "statistics": {"dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "0", "likeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M38S"}, "snippet": {"channelId": "UCAmJi81_XzOYijpFVHL-3qQ", "tags": ["how to invest in gold", "gold investment", "invest in gold", "investing in gold .gold investments", "how to invest in gold and silver", "gold investing", "investing in gold and silver", "gold investment companies", "gold 401k rollover", "goldandsilver", "investment", "wheatonpreciousmetals", "preciousmetalsprices", "goldsilver prices", "texaspreciousmetals", "boldpreciousmetals", "preciousmetalsetf", "monarchpreciousmetals", "aceyourretirement", "enjoyyourretirement", "{how to invest i..."], "description": "https://rebrand.ly/Goldco5     \nGet More Info Now\n\nThe Buzz on Unallocated Precious Metals: Investing, Low Fees :: TIAA Bank\n\n\n\nAs a stunt to publicise the 99.999% pure one-ounce Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, in 2007 the Royal Canadian Mint made a 100 kg 99.999% gold coin, with a stated value of $1 million, and now makes them to order, but at a substantial premium over the market value of the gold.\n\nSilver coins have ended up being popular with collectors due to their relative affordability, and, unlike a lot of gold and platinum concerns which are valued based upon the markets, silver problems are regularly valued as collectibles, far higher than their real bullion value.
