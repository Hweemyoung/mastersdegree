The rupture of an aneurysm is often a fatal scenario, whereas during treatment serious complications for the patient can occur. Whether an aneurysm ruptures or whether a treatment is successful depends on the interaction of different morphological such as wall deformation and thickness, and hemodynamic attributes like wall shear stress and pressure. Therefore, medical researchers are very interested in better understanding these relationships. However, the required analysis is a time-consuming process, where suspicious wall regions are difficult to detect due to the time-dependent behavior of the data. Our proposed visualization framework enables medical researchers to efficiently assess aneurysm risk and treatment options. This comprises a powerful set of views including 2D and 3D depictions of the aneurysm morphology as well as statistical plots of different scalar fields. Brushing and linking aids the user to identify interesting wall regions and to understand the influence of different attributes on the aneurysm's state. Moreover, a visual comparison of pre- and post-treatment as well as different treatment options is provided. Our analysis techniques are designed in collaboration with domain experts, e.g., physicians, and we provide details about the evaluation.", "publishedAt": "2019-03-12T16:19:59Z", "tags": ["Visual Analysis", "Aneurysm", "Statistical Graphics", "multi-field data", "rupture", "visualization", "scatterplot", "glyphs"], "title": "Visual Analysis of Aneurysm Data using Statistical Graphics", "channelId": "UCU-1cyJR-Lz41Yr8RHzQvMQ", "channelTitle": "Scientific Visualization"}}]}, {"q": "ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844", "idx_paper": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865192", "items": [{"statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "5"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT13M27S"}, "id": "Yp7lFtsSOXw", "snippet": {"description": "arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02089\nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327125763_Origin-Destination_Flow_Maps_in_Immersive_Environments\nIEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844/\n\nPreview video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcC50RVywXc\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-KUlV0U6M\nTalk video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp7lFtsSOXw\n\nCheck other publications at: https://vis.yalongyang.com/publications.html", "publishedAt": "2020-06-19T18:49:07Z", "tags": ["Immersive Analytics", "Virtual Reality", "Augmented Reality", "Thematic Maps", "Geographic Visualization", "Catography", "Information Visualization", "Interaction", "Origin-Destination", "Flow Maps", "Geospatial network"], "title": "[InfoVis 18 Talk] Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments", "channelId": "UC4anJfe9RKFcuZC_6G_xh0g", "channelTitle": "Yalong Yang's Vis"}}]}, {"q": "ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844", "idx_paper": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865192", "items": [{"statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "5"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT31S"}, "id": "lcC50RVywXc", "snippet": {"description": "arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02089\nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327125763_Origin-Destination_Flow_Maps_in_Immersive_Environments\nIEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844/\n\nPreview video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcC50RVywXc\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-KUlV0U6M\nTalk video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp7lFtsSOXw\n\nCheck other publications at: https://vis.yalongyang.com/publications.html", "publishedAt": "2020-06-19T18:46:15Z", "tags": ["Immersive Analytics", "Virtual Reality", "Augmented Reality", "Thematic Maps", "Geographic Visualization", "Catography", "Information Visualization", "Interaction", "Origin-Destination", "Flow Maps", "Geospatial network"], "title": "[InfoVis 18 Preview] Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments", "channelId": "UC4anJfe9RKFcuZC_6G_xh0g", "channelTitle": "Yalong Yang's Vis"}}]}, {"q": "ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844", "idx_paper": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865192", "items": [{"statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "0", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "2"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M35S"}, "id": "Sj-KUlV0U6M", "snippet": {"description": "arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02089\nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327125763_Origin-Destination_Flow_Maps_in_Immersive_Environments\nIEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440844/\n\nPreview video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcC50RVywXc\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj-KUlV0U6M\nTalk video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp7lFtsSOXw\n\nCheck other publications at: https://vis.yalongyang.com/publications.html", "publishedAt": "2020-06-19T18:37:26Z", "tags": ["Immersive Analytics", "Virtual Reality", "Augmented Reality", "Thematic Maps", "Geographic Visualization", "Catography", "Information Visualization"], "title": "[InfoVis 18 Demo] Origin Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments", "channelId": "UC4anJfe9RKFcuZC_6G_xh0g", "channelTitle": "Yalong Yang's Vis"}}]}, {"q": "ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466595", "idx_paper": "10.1109/TII.2018.2870662", "items": [{"statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "1", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "10"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT14S"}, "id": "z2Pea4zp9TU", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCQFoL2ndURGtGlCLEjyt9NQ", "title": "[201901] Adaptive Motion Planning Based on Vehicle Characteristics and Regulations for Off-Road UGVs", "publishedAt": "2020-06-28T17:53:59Z", "description": "Yonghoon Ji, Yusuke Tanaka, Yusuke Tamura, Mai Kimura, Atsushi Umemura, Yoshiharu Kaneshima, Hiroki Murakami, Atsushi Yamashita, and Hajime Asama, \"Adaptive Motion Planning Based on Vehicle Characteristics and Regulations for Off-Road UGVs,\" IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Vol. 15, No, 1, pp. 599 -
