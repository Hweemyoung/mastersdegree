A 2019 study, randomized participants to 3 groups: 9 hours of sleep, 5 hours of sleep with weekend catch-up sleep, and 5 hours of sleep without catch-up sleep.  In the sleep deprived (5 hour) groups, there was significantly more insulin resistance, calorie intake, and weight gain regardless of catch-up sleep.  Tramadol is prescribed 25 million times a year in the USA, usually to avoid prescribing traditional opiates such as Percocet or Oxycodone. Tramadol has complex pharmacology in that is is both an SNRI and mu-opiate agonist after metabolism in the liver. The pharmacogenetics of this vary greatly between people. Many people have rapid metabolism that will lead to increased opiate effects. Other medications interfere with metabolism (such as SSRI\u2019s). A recent study demonstrated increased risk of hypoglycemia in diabetics taking Tramadol. Use caution when prescribing this drug.  Sepsis resuscitation has traditionally been gauged by following lactate levels on the  presumption that lactate is an adequate marker of organ perfusion. Unfortunately, lactate levels are often elevated by medications and other health conditions such as kidney or liver disease, making lactate an often ineffective biomarker for perfusion. The Andromeda-Shock trial compared using capillary refill to lactate as guides for resuscitation with the primary endpoint of reducing 28-day mortality.  The capillary refill group had a 9% absolute risk reduction in mortality, but this did not reach statistical significance. However, capillary refill can be used as another data point while resuscitating your septic patients.  When should you start pressors for patients in septic shock? A 2019 study compared routine resuscitation (30cc/kg fluid bolus) to initiation of norepinephrine with the first 30cc/kg crystalloid. They found that the early pressor group had significantly more \u201cshock control\u201d (MAP&gt;65) at 6 hours, compared to the control group. While there was a trend towards less mortality in the early pressor group, it was not statistically significant. Keep an eye out for more studies in this area!  A recent study in JAMA found that 88% of deaths from sepsis were unavoidable, due to severe chronic comorbidities. Remember that patients will still die from septic shock despite your best efforts and knowledge of the newest literature.    \r\n\r\n References\r\n\r\n Depner CM, Melanson EL, Eckel RH, Snell-Bergeon JK, Perreault L, Bergman BC, Higgins JA, Guerin MK, Stothard ER, Morton SJ, Wright KP Jr. Curr Biol. 2019 Feb 11. pii: S0960-9822(19)30098-3. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2019.01.069.

Politicians who deny or cast scepticism about the anthropogenic nature of climate change and/or its substantial implications; and those who blame climate change for the detrimental environmental impacts of their policies.\n\nPosing the very question \u201cclimatic or regionally induced by humans?\u201d, we investigated the dramatic drying of Lake Urmia over the past decades. Lake Urmia\u2014a unique aquatic ecosystem and UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve\u2014has shrunk by around 80% of its volume compared to 1970s. Lake Urmia drying is a quintessential example of environmental tragedies happening around the globe.\n\nAnalysing ground and satellite hydro-climatic data over the past five decades, we showed that the lake desiccation has been driven by aggressive and unsustainable expansion of agricultural activities and water withdrawals upstream, and that climatic factors have played only a small or negligible role so far.

We investigate the regulation of RNA and protein threshold crossing propensities in Escherichia coli. From in vivo single RNA time-lapse microscopy data from multiple promoters, mutants, induction schemes and media, we study the asymmetry and tailedness (quanti\ufb01ed by the skewness and kurtosis, respectively) of the distributions of\ntime intervals between transcription events. We \ufb01nd that higher thresholds can be reached by increasing the skewness and kurtosis, which is shown to be achievable without a\ufb00ecting mean and coe\ufb03cient of variation, by regulating the rate-limiting steps in transcription initiation. Also, they propagate to the skewness and kurtosis of the distributions of protein expression levels in cell populations.

The finding was highly significant because it showed that dark matter is not always associated with traditional matter on a galactic scale. It also ruled out several theories that said dark matter is not a substance but a manifestation of the laws of gravity on a cosmic scale.\n\nInvisible dark matter typically dominates the makeup of galaxies. Finding an object without dark matter was unprecedented and led to a good deal of debate within the scientific community.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one object, you always have a little voice in the back of your mind saying, \"but what if you\u2019re wrong?\u2019\u201d said team leader Pieter van Dokkum, the Sol Goldman Family Professor of Astronomy at Yale. \u201cEven though we did all the checks we could think of, we were worried that nature had thrown us for a loop and had conspired to make something look really special whereas it was really something more mundane.\u201d\n\nNow, a pair of new studies appearing in The Astrophysical Journal Letters supports the team\u2019s initial finding.\n\nYale graduate student Shany Danieli, who first spotted the galaxy about two years ago, is the lead author of one of the new studies (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0e8c). It confirms the team\u2019s initial observations of DF2, using more precise measurements from the W.M. Keck Observatory\u2019s Keck Cosmic Web Imager. The researchers found that the stars inside the galaxy are moving at a speed consistent with the mass of the galaxy\u2019s normal matter. If there were dark matter in DF2, the stars would be moving much faster.\n\nVan Dokkum is lead author of the other new study (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0d92/meta), which details the discovery of a econd galaxy devoid of dark matter. That galaxy is named DF4.\n\n\u201cDiscovering a second galaxy with very little to no dark matter is just as exciting as the initial discovery of DF2,\u201d van Dokkum said. \u201cThis means the chances of finding more of these galaxies are now higher than we previously thought. Since we have no good ideas for how these galaxies are formed, I hope these discoveries will encourage more scientists to work on this puzzle.\u201d\n\nBoth DF2 and DF4 are part of a relatively new class of galaxies called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). They are as large as the Milky Way but have between 100 to 1,000 times fewer stars. This makes them appear fluffy and translucent \u2014 and difficult to observe.\n\nIronically, the lack of dark matter in these UDGs strengthens the case for dark matter, the researchers say. It proves that dark matter is a substance that is not coupled with normal matter, since they can be found separately.\n\nDanieli is leading a wide area survey with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array \u2014 a telescope designed by van Dokkum \u2014 to look for more examples in a systematic way, then observe candidates again using the Keck telescopes.\n\n\u201cWe hope to next find out how common these galaxies are and whether they exist in other areas of the universe,\u201d Danieli said. \u201cWe want to find more evidence that will help us understand how the properties of these galaxies work with our current theories. Our hope is that this will take us one step further in understanding one of the biggest mysteries in our universe \u2014 the nature of dark matter.\u201d

Learning objectives:\n\n\u2022 The Arrhenius equation and the Classical Marcus equation have the same foundations.\n\u2022 In the Semi-Classical Marcus equation the pre-exponential factor only contains the solvent reorganization energy. The exponential term incorporates a specific vibration that mediates the electron transfer and is important for the vibronic coupling.\n\u2022 Molecular vibrations can mix into electronic transitions, thereby playing an important role in transfer processes.\n\n\u2022 Photochemistry has a direct link with quantum chemistry.\n\u2022 Intermolecular (or interchromophoric) interactions in the excited state can lead to electronic interactions enabling transfer processes.\n\n\nFor more information see:\nElectron Transfer Reactions in Chemistry: Theory and Experiment (Nobel Lecture)\u2020\nProf. Dr. Rudolph A.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:\n\nSelf-archiving - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.\nOpen access journal: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.\nOpen access journal funded by article processing charges paid by authors or research sponsor - gold\nOpen access journal funded by an academic institution, learned society or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum, diamond, or gold\nDelayed open-access journals - provide open access after an embargo period, typically 6\u201312 months or longer\nHybrid open access journals at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication feeAdvantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals.

The management of contaminated sediment is often expensive and time-consuming, involving millions of dollars over many years at a single site. However, an easier solution may be coming to a regulatory agency near you. Passive sampling methods offer several advantages over traditional remediation and monitoring techniques, and are the focus of this podcast episode. \n\nBio for Marc Greenberg\n\n\nDr Marc S Greenberg is the Deputy Branch Chief of the USEPA\u2019s the Environmental Response Team. His office supports various clean-up, emergency, and other response actions within the USEPA Superfund program. Marc\u2019s technical area of focus has been the assessment, remediation, and management of contaminated sediment sites. His research experience includes both human health and aquatic ecological toxicology. Marc has provided technical and policy advice in the fields of contaminated sediments and soils, toxicology, ecological risk assessment, and oil spill response. He has mentored and coached numerous technical specialists inside and outside the Agency. Dr Greenberg has served as a member of the EPA Contaminated Sediments Technical Advisory Group (CSTAG), Risk Assessment Forum Ecological Oversight Committee, Superfund Sediments Team, and EPA Headquarters Chair of the Agency\u2019s Ecological Risk Assessment Forum (ERAF). He has participated in the standardizing of sediment toxicity testing methods for the USEPA, has co-authored many EPA technical and guidance documents, and has contributed to the authorship of numerous peer-reviewed papers and book chapters. He is an active member of the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), and he served on its North America Board of Directors (2007-2010) and Editorial Board for the SETAC journals (2010-2012). He obtained a BA in Zoology (1990) and a MS in Aquatic Toxicology (1993) from Miami University, and a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from Wright State University (2002). \n\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\nParkerton and Maruya, Passive sampling in contaminated sediment assessment: Building consensus to improve decision making , IEAM 10#2:163\u2013166.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1488/abstract\n\nLydy et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: State of the science for organic contaminants, IEAM 10#2:167\u2013178.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1503/abstract\n\nPeijnenburg et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: State of the science for metals, IEAM 10#2:179\u2013196.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1502/abstract\n\nMayer et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Scientific rationale supporting use of freely dissolved concentrations, IEAM 10#2:197\u2013209.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1508/abstract\n\nGhosh et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Practical guidance for selection, calibration, and implementation, IEAM 10#2:210\u2013223.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1507/abstract\n\nGreenberg et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Risk assessment and management, IEAM 10#2:224-236. \nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1511/abstract", "title": "IEAM Podcast 15:Sedimentary, my dear Watson.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models.

Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals.

In case of a broader view, what IWRM stands for is the integrated approach that should consider ecosystem services along similar lines because when an IWRM plan decides on the allocation of water in the landscape, it inadvertently also decides on the redistribution of ecosystem services that are derived at that location. These IWR management decisions also have an impact on how regulatory ecosystems services (with mostly public interests) and provisioning ecosystem services (with more individual interest at stake) can be harnessed. Our economic minded approach on the terrestrial water cycle will help to structure all these issues of local water uses and mitigation within one frame.\n\nSPEAKERS: G\u00e1bor Ungv\u00e1ri, Senior Water Economist, REKK.AQUA | Andras Kis - Water Economist, Corvinus University of Budapest", "title": "The Role of Economics and Economic Policy in IWRM and Climate Change", "publishedAt": "2020-07-08T07:41:22Z", "tags": ["Water", "Youth", "Network", "IWRM", "Economics", "Policy", "Climate", "Change", "Cycle", "Integrated Water Resources Management", "webinar"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H9M53S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "5", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2000", "q": "10.1002/fee.2000", "items": [{"id": "Yw9HP9GiuC0", "snippet": {"channelId": "UCz4XeFB4sthzMlEmUcfoo9w", "channelTitle": "Sierra Tucson", "description": "The Tiramisu Approach to Treatment Resistant Depression: Integrating Psychotherapy, Pharmacology, CAM and Neurotherapeutics\n\nPresented by Jasleen Chhatwal, MD, Associate Medical Director; Director of Mood Recovery.

My analysis reveals that their grazing protocol yielding the fastest rate of soil-sequestered carbon also produces an amount of methane from enteric fermentation that far outweighs any reduction in atmospheric greenhouse gas resulting from carbon sequestered by the soil upon which their steers graze.\n\nComparing the findings of Franzluebbers & Stuedemann to those of Huntington reveals that if the highest objective is to reduce the greenhouse gas impacts of atmospheric carbon, then forestland should remain undisturbed. Forestland that has become unproductive cropland should be returned to forest if possible, not maintained as pasture. And because the heat-trapping properties of enteric fermentation-emitted methane\u00a0will far outweigh any benefits associated with increased soil-sequestered C, the least desirable option would be to manage unproductive cropland as cattlegrazed pasture, even under the best grazing management.\n\nA more detailed treatment of the issues presented in this video is found in Mike Hudak\u2019s essay \u201cClaims That Livestock Grazing Enhances Soil Sequestration of Atmospheric Carbon are Outweighed by Methane Emissions from Enteric Fermentation: A Closer Look at Franzluebbers and Stuedemann (2009)\u201d available in both HTML and PDF format at http://www.mikehudak.com/Articles/FranzluebbersAndStuedemannCritique.html\n\nReferences cited in the video\n\nAllen, D.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:\n\nSelf-archiving - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.\nOpen access journal: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.\nOpen access journal funded by article processing charges paid by authors or research sponsor - gold\nOpen access journal funded by an academic institution, learned society or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum, diamond, or gold\nDelayed open-access journals - provide open access after an embargo period, typically 6\u201312 months or longer\nHybrid open access journals at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication feeAdvantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals. There are many publishers that started up as open access-only  publishers, such as PLOS, Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Frontiers in... journals, MDPI and BioMed Central.", "title": "Open access | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-28T00:16:09Z", "tags": ["open access", "academic publishing", "electronic publishing", "free culture movement", "open access (publishing)", "open access journals", "scholarly communication", "social movements", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT45M34S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "7", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2001", "q": "10.1002/fee.2001", "items": [{"id": "VKBjfDsDES4", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCsPs4JQVxo2-IjKMs4NkZPg", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "wikipedia tts", "description": "This is an audio version of the Wikipedia Article:\r\nAcademic journal\r\n\r\nListening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading.

Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny, and discussion of research. They are usually peer-reviewed or refereed. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to Henry Oldenburg (the first editor of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society), is to give researchers a venue to \"impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.\"The term academic journal applies to scholarly publications in all fields; this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals. Scientific journals and journals of the quantitative social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities and qualitative social sciences; their specific aspects are separately discussed.\nThe first academic journal was Journal des s\u00e7avans (January 1665), followed soon after by Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (March 1665), and M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (1666). The first fully peer-reviewed journal was Medical Essays and Observations (1733).", "title": "Academic journal | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T05:14:55Z", "tags": ["academic journal", "academic journals", "academic publishing", "peer review", "scholarly communication", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT18M44S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "11", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2001", "q": "10.1002/fee.2001", "items": [{"id": "D9GoCe9N3p8", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Audiopedia", "channelId": "UCV63FScHnShoobfaENC8R_Q", "description": "An academic journal is a peer-reviewed periodical in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published.

The management of contaminated sediment is often expensive and time-consuming, involving millions of dollars over many years at a single site. However, an easier solution may be coming to a regulatory agency near you. Passive sampling methods offer several advantages over traditional remediation and monitoring techniques, and are the focus of this podcast episode. \n\nBio for Marc Greenberg\n\n\nDr Marc S Greenberg is the Deputy Branch Chief of the USEPA\u2019s the Environmental Response Team. His office supports various clean-up, emergency, and other response actions within the USEPA Superfund program. Marc\u2019s technical area of focus has been the assessment, remediation, and management of contaminated sediment sites. His research experience includes both human health and aquatic ecological toxicology. Marc has provided technical and policy advice in the fields of contaminated sediments and soils, toxicology, ecological risk assessment, and oil spill response. He has mentored and coached numerous technical specialists inside and outside the Agency. Dr Greenberg has served as a member of the EPA Contaminated Sediments Technical Advisory Group (CSTAG), Risk Assessment Forum Ecological Oversight Committee, Superfund Sediments Team, and EPA Headquarters Chair of the Agency\u2019s Ecological Risk Assessment Forum (ERAF). He has participated in the standardizing of sediment toxicity testing methods for the USEPA, has co-authored many EPA technical and guidance documents, and has contributed to the authorship of numerous peer-reviewed papers and book chapters. He is an active member of the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC), and he served on its North America Board of Directors (2007-2010) and Editorial Board for the SETAC journals (2010-2012). He obtained a BA in Zoology (1990) and a MS in Aquatic Toxicology (1993) from Miami University, and a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from Wright State University (2002). \n\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\nParkerton and Maruya, Passive sampling in contaminated sediment assessment: Building consensus to improve decision making , IEAM 10#2:163\u2013166.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1488/abstract\n\nLydy et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: State of the science for organic contaminants, IEAM 10#2:167\u2013178.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1503/abstract\n\nPeijnenburg et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: State of the science for metals, IEAM 10#2:179\u2013196.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1502/abstract\n\nMayer et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Scientific rationale supporting use of freely dissolved concentrations, IEAM 10#2:197\u2013209.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1508/abstract\n\nGhosh et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Practical guidance for selection, calibration, and implementation, IEAM 10#2:210\u2013223.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1507/abstract\n\nGreenberg et al., Passive sampling methods for contaminated sediments: Risk assessment and management, IEAM 10#2:224-236. \nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1511/abstract", "title": "IEAM Podcast 15:Sedimentary, my dear Watson.

I\u2019m Lauren, and this is BrainStuff. The other day I was shopping at Bavmorda\u2019s Trebuchet and Millinery Emporium and I started wondering -- why do so many prices end in the number 9?\n\nYou might have wondered the same thing too, and if you have, it\u2019s not just your imagination. Studies have shown that many retailers disproportionately use prices within 5 cents of the nearest dollar, 1 cent of the nearest 10 cents, $5 of the nearest $100 or $1000, and within $1 of the nearest 10-dollar amount. \n\nPrices like this are often known as \u201ccharm\u201d prices, \u201codd\u201d prices, \u201cmagic\u201d prices, or \u201cpsychological pricing.\u201d Pricetags ending in the number 9 are especially common. But why?\n\nThese days, two main psychological theories of charm pricing have emerged. And yes, this is a field of study. For the purpose of this video, we\u2019ll call them the \u201crounding off\u201d theory and the \u201cbargain signaling\u201d theory.\n\nThe rounding off theory argues that shoppers tend to pay a lot more attention to the first digits in a listed price. So, when you see a product labels $29.99, even though it's only 1 penny off from being 30 bucks, the theory goes that you mentally round down to think of it as a $20 price point based on that first digit. \n\nFor example, a 2005 study found that prices ending in 99 cents caused shoppers to make math errors that even-dollar prices did not. It worked like this: Test shoppers were given an allowance of exactly 73 bucks, and they were then asked to estimate how many products they could buy with this allowance. It turned out that when 99-cent endings were in the picture, shoppers overestimated their spending power. \n\nIn other words, they thought they could buy significantly more products at prices like $2.99 and $5.99 than they could at $3 and $6. This seems to suggest that we do tend to \u201cround down\u201d and ignore the final digits in prices, even though it makes no economic sense to do so.\n\nThe bargain signaling theory suggests that odd prices work the same way \u201cSale\u201d signs do, meaning they imply to shoppers that the price listed is especially good. Maybe the weird specificity of something priced $5.98 or $2.39 makes us think that the store is selling that bag of Gummy Bears at the lowest price point they can possibly afford. Or maybe we\u2019ve all been conditioned by marketing to associate odd prices, especially the ones ending in 9, with sales and discounts.\n\nIn 2003, researchers showed that in some cases, you could actually increase demand for an item by raising the price so that it ended in a \u20189,\u2019 which would seem to contradict rational economics. \n\nOne example they studied: A $34 dress in a clothing catalog. By raising the price from 34 bucks to 39 bucks, demand for the dress actually went up. When they raised the price to $44, however, the trend didn\u2019t hold -- so it wasn\u2019t just that buyers liked paying more for their clothes. \n\nSince 34 and 39 both start with the same digit, this would seem to favor the bargain signaling theory rather than the rounding off theory. Something about the 9 just seemed to make people think they were getting a good deal.\n\nSo it looks like our penchant for buying at the 9s might be explained by a mixture of our tendency to round down to the leftmost digit AND our beliefs that 9s inherently indicate bargains.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nhttp://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/678484?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents \n\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/01/the-psychological-difference-between-1200-and-1167/384993/ \n\nhttp://timharford.com/2012/06/pound-for-pound-99p-is-worth-every-penny/ \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/weekinreview/08arango.html?_r=0 \n\nhttp://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/business/files/Schindler-2006.pdf\n\nhttp://dept.camden.rutgers.edu/business/files/Bizer-Schindler-2005.pdf \n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.20084/abstract\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2003/09/mind-your-pricing-cues \n\nhttp://classes.bus.oregonstate.edu/fall-05/ba499/elton/Articles/Mind%20Your%20Pricing%20Cues.pdf \n\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1023581927405\n\nhttp://www.ozshy.50webs.com/21why99.pdf \n\nhttps://www_nelsonpricing_com_ar.1.com.ar/biblioteca_pricing/1997-02_why_are_so_many_goods_priced_to_end_in_nine_Basu_K.pdf \n\nhttp://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V8/MB_V8_N1_Holdershaw.pdf", "title": "Why Do So Many Price Tags End In .99?", "publishedAt": "2016-04-19T16:00:04Z", "tags": ["brainstuff", "brain stuff", "howstuffworks", "how stuff works", "science", "technology", "lauren vogelbaum", "techstuff", "fw thinking", "pricing", "price", "psychology", "99 cents", "98 cents", "99", "98", "95 cents", "95", "price tag", "price tags", "psychological pricing", "nine", "ninety-nine", "cents", "odd pricing", "odd prices", "charm prices", "charm pricing", "rounding", "price point", "price points", "economics", "marketing", "sale", "sales", "advertising", "advertisement", "advertisements", "why do price tags end in .99"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M24S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "7821", "viewCount": "389560", "dislikeCount": "372", "commentCount": "1475", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "Wz5NNlVvsJ0", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCswDRl-HHHtYvuuXKpVmQtg", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "MRU: Focus on Teaching & Learning", "description": "", "title": "ACCN 5507 Delirium", "publishedAt": "2020-05-05T18:19:51Z", "tags": ["MRU", "Learning", "Teaching", "Education", "Mount Royal University", "Teaching and Learning"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT14M46S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "viewCount": "22", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "V-FuySSUc-g", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "EMC CMP", "channelId": "UCK1OkDMYF3nWyb3htcsZjzQ", "description": "- LA MALNUTRICI\u00d3N HOSPITALARIA, SITUACI\u00d3N EN LATINOAM\u00c9RICA Y EL PER\u00da.\n- SITUACI\u00d3N DE LA FORMACI\u00d3N M\u00c9DICA EN SOPORTE NUTRICIONAL ESPECIALIZADO.\n- IMPLEMENTACI\u00d3N Y FORTALECIMIENTO DEL SOPORTE NUTRICIONAL ESPECIALIZADO.", "title": "CURSO SOPORTE NUTRICIONAL ESPECIALIZADO SESI\u00d3N 01", "publishedAt": "2019-06-29T05:36:54Z"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2H21M37S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "4", "viewCount": "180", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "_Kl5K0wnJN0", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Samira Alyatim", "channelId": "UC0NDh5xLkp_lDnij_icPy3A", "description": "Presented by Samira Alyatim,  Amberton University, Dr. DiAnn Sanchez, Fall 2016", "title": "Samira Alyatim, HRT6575 E1, Graduate Project Presentation", "publishedAt": "2016-11-10T03:53:08Z"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT48M"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "52", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "Y_1aF7bgODw", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "pt-BR", "channelId": "UCrf7ydas1Md28mEQt_C55_g", "channelTitle": "Rede Barragens Amaz\u00f4nicas / Amazon Dams Network", "description": "On this webinar, the researchers   Dr. Lucas Bair  from U.

International efforts to address concerns over ecotoxicological effects from EDS include both risk- and hazard-based approaches to preventing adverse effects, depending on the country or intergovernmental agency. A recent SETAC Pellston workshop convened researchers from all over the world to advise on how regulators and policy makers can make science-based decisions when evaluating EDS. Workshop organizer and lead author Peter Matthiessen joins us to discuss the synthesis paper from the workshop, \u201cRecommended approaches to the scientific evaluation of ecotoxicological hazards and risks of endocrine-active substances.\u201d His article leads off the special series \u201cEcotoxicological Hazard and Risk Assessment Approaches for Endocrine-Active Substances.\u201d (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.1885/full) Access the full series in the March 2017 issue of IEAM (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.v13.2/issuetoc).\n\nAbout the Guest\n\nDr Peter Matthiessen is an aquatic ecotoxicologist with over 45 years' experience in this subject. Most of his career has been spent in various UK government institutes conducting research on the effects of pollutants on fish and invertebrates in the field, but he has also been self-employed as an independent consultant ecotoxicologist for the last 10 years. Since the mid-1980s, he has been deeply involved in the issue of endocrine disruption, and he has conducted extensive research on the masculinizing effects of organotins in mollusks and feminizing effects of estrogens in fish. More recently, he has been involved in research on pollution damage to the hormonal stress response in wild fish. He is an expert on the environmental risk assessment of chemicals and acts as an adviser to the UK Government (Hazardous Substances Advisory Committee - HSAC).  He also co-chairs the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Validation Management Group for Ecotoxicity Tests (VMG-eco). In the latter capacity, he has helped to develop a suite of new ecotoxicity tests diagnostic for certain endocrine disrupters, and written guidance for interpreting their mechanistic and apical results. He has published over 140 peer-reviewed book and journal articles and is also a SETAC Fellow.\nArticles Referenced in this Podcast\nMatthiessen P et al. 2017.

Other mismatches occur when the time scales over which the system responds are much longer than time scales over which actions are typically taken. Concrete examples range from the dynamics of diseases to insect outbreaks to issues related to global change. Various approaches are being developed to deal with these issues based on ideas from dynamical systems, but much more work is needed to understand dynamics, especially when the effects of changing external inputs are included leading to nonautonomous systems. I will present a number of concrete examples ranging from small scales (coral-algal-grazer systems) to larger scales and use these to illustrate and motivate a presentation of current understanding of dynamical systems modeling ecological systems on intermediate time scales. I will specifically consider management questions and will also present results illustrating the complexities introduced by considering explicit time dependence.\n\n\nAlan Hastings\nUniversity of California, Davis, U.S.\n\n\nSession Chair: Ami Radunskaya, Pomona College, U.S.\n\n\nThis virtual plenary talk was originally scheduled for the 2020 SIAM Conference on Life Sciences.

This results in high morbidity and makes MDD one of the leading causes of disability in the world per the World Health Organization. Early intervention, intensive and multimodal treatment are key to improving outcomes in this patient population. Challenges inherent to treatment include polymorphism in the presentation, multifactorial etiology and complex pathophysiology.

Other mismatches occur when the time scales over which the system responds are much longer than time scales over which actions are typically taken. Concrete examples range from the dynamics of diseases to insect outbreaks to issues related to global change. Various approaches are being developed to deal with these issues based on ideas from dynamical systems, but much more work is needed to understand dynamics, especially when the effects of changing external inputs are included leading to nonautonomous systems. I will present a number of concrete examples ranging from small scales (coral-algal-grazer systems) to larger scales and use these to illustrate and motivate a presentation of current understanding of dynamical systems modeling ecological systems on intermediate time scales. I will specifically consider management questions and will also present results illustrating the complexities introduced by considering explicit time dependence.\n\n\nAlan Hastings\nUniversity of California, Davis, U.S.\n\n\nSession Chair: Ami Radunskaya, Pomona College, U.S.\n\n\nThis virtual plenary talk was originally scheduled for the 2020 SIAM Conference on Life Sciences.

Other mismatches occur when the time scales over which the system responds are much longer than time scales over which actions are typically taken. Concrete examples range from the dynamics of diseases to insect outbreaks to issues related to global change. Various approaches are being developed to deal with these issues based on ideas from dynamical systems, but much more work is needed to understand dynamics, especially when the effects of changing external inputs are included leading to nonautonomous systems. I will present a number of concrete examples ranging from small scales (coral-algal-grazer systems) to larger scales and use these to illustrate and motivate a presentation of current understanding of dynamical systems modeling ecological systems on intermediate time scales. I will specifically consider management questions and will also present results illustrating the complexities introduced by considering explicit time dependence.\n \n\nAlan M.

Specifically, it is \"the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers\". An alternative term suggested \"as a more descriptive name for the discipline\" is interactive decision theory. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science, and biology. The subject first addressed zero-sum games, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants. Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science, including both humans and non-humans (e.g. computers).\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Game theory", "publishedAt": "2014-07-19T10:16:58Z"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H4M4S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "17", "viewCount": "4008", "dislikeCount": "2", "commentCount": "4", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "2hdF02c8Hrw", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Audiopedia", "channelId": "UCV63FScHnShoobfaENC8R_Q", "description": "A solar cell (also called a photovoltaic cell) is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect.

The city is also the capital of the surrounding county of Tirana, one of 12 constituent counties of the country. By air, it is 501 kilometres (311 miles) north of Athens, 613 kilometres (381 miles) southeast of Rome, 153 kilometres (95 miles) southwest of Skopje and 131 kilometres (81 miles) south of Podgorica.\nTirana was founded as a city in 1614, but the region that today corresponds to the city territory has been continuously inhabited since the Bronze Age. As most of Albania, the area was populated by several Illyrian tribes, but had no importance within Illyria. Indeed, it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars. The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana. Further later in the 5th and 6th century, a Paleo Christian basilica was built around this site. \nWhen the Roman Empire divided into east and west, its successor the Byzantine Empire took control and included the construction of the Petrel\u00eb Castle, under the reign of Justinian I. Until the 20th century, the city did not attain much significance, when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as the country's capital, after the country's declaration of independence in 1912.\nTirana is located in the center of the country surrounded by mountains and hills, with Dajt on the east and a slight valley opening on the northwest, overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. Due to its location within the Tirana plain and the close proximity to the Adriatic Sea, the city is influenced by a mediterranean seasonal climate. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.Being a primate city, Tirana is considered the economic and cultural hub of Albania, due to its significant location and importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education, service, research and healthcare. All of the country's largest companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Tirana is also the seat of power of the Government of Albania, the residences for work of the President and Prime Minister of Albania.", "title": "Tirana | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-29T12:08:08Z", "tags": ["capitals in europe", "cities in albania", "tirana", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT56M20S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "viewCount": "97", "dislikeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2005", "q": "10.1002/fee.2005", "items": [{"id": "NjB2io9X_cA", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCBnHyctC62ph9p86yBM-I8A", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "wikipedia tts", "description": "This is an audio version of the Wikipedia Article:\r\nOpen access\r\n\r\nListening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:\n\nSelf-archiving - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.\nOpen access journal: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.\nOpen access journal funded by article processing charges paid by authors or research sponsor - gold\nOpen access journal funded by an academic institution, learned society or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum, diamond, or gold\nDelayed open-access journals - provide open access after an embargo period, typically 6\u201312 months or longer\nHybrid open access journals at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication feeAdvantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals.

Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. As of  2014, with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole, eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of game theory to biology.", "title": "Game theory | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-27T06:05:53Z", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "formal sciences", "game theory", "john von neumann", "mathematical economics", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H1M56S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "65", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2008", "q": "10.1002/fee.2008", "items": [{"id": "LgijQcbC4KA", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB", "channelId": "UC2bbtBxOHlUWRIubS-CHf5A", "channelTitle": "Future of Work Institute", "description": "In this virtual lecture, Meredith Carr, Registered Psychologist and Research Officer at the Future of Work Institute, gives an in-depth introduction to the Communication Analysis Tool (CAT) and how it can be used to capture team dynamics. \n\nVisit https://cat.ctwd.com.au/ for more information.", "title": "Capturing Team Dynamics using CAT  |  Virtual Lecture by Meredith Carr", "publishedAt": "2020-06-30T08:32:29Z", "tags": ["FOWI", "Curtin University", "IO Psychology"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT39M29S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "20", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2008", "q": "10.1002/fee.2008", "items": [{"id": "aw8iBwJRjVo", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US", "channelId": "UC58HX2OgFPb3O8nnOIFDkXg", "channelTitle": "Bilal Hijazeen", "description": "This is a submission for the final project of module 7, HCD:510\nI hope you enjoy it and find it very useful \n\nThe References list: \n\n1.

In 2014, it generated 5583TWh, 25% more electricity than the US. In April 1996, an Electric Power Law was implemented, a major event in China's electric power industry. The law set out to promote the development of the electric power industry, to protect legal rights of investors, managers and consumers, and to regulate generation, distribution and consumption. Most of the electricity in China is produced from fossil fuels. In particular, about 79% of annual electricity was produced with coal in China between 2004-2010.\nChina has abundant energy. The country has the world's third-largest coal reserves and massive hydroelectric resources.

Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls. It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles, and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.

The city is also the capital of the surrounding county of Tirana, one of 12 constituent counties of the country. By air, it is 501 kilometres (311 miles) north of Athens, 613 kilometres (381 miles) southeast of Rome, 153 kilometres (95 miles) southwest of Skopje and 131 kilometres (81 miles) south of Podgorica.\nTirana was founded as a city in 1614, but the region that today corresponds to the city territory has been continuously inhabited since the Bronze Age. As most of Albania, the area was populated by several Illyrian tribes, but had no importance within Illyria. Indeed, it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars. The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana. Further later in the 5th and 6th century, a Paleo Christian basilica was built around this site. \nWhen the Roman Empire divided into east and west, its successor the Byzantine Empire took control and included the construction of the Petrel\u00eb Castle, under the reign of Justinian I. Until the 20th century, the city did not attain much significance, when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as the country's capital, after the country's declaration of independence in 1912.\nTirana is located in the center of the country surrounded by mountains and hills, with Dajt on the east and a slight valley opening on the northwest, overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. Due to its location within the Tirana plain and the close proximity to the Adriatic Sea, the city is influenced by a mediterranean seasonal climate. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.Being a primate city, Tirana is considered the economic and cultural hub of Albania, due to its significant location and importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education, service, research and healthcare. All of the country's largest companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Tirana is also the seat of power of the Government of Albania, the residences for work of the President and Prime Minister of Albania.", "title": "Tirana | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-29T12:08:08Z", "tags": ["capitals in europe", "cities in albania", "tirana", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT56M20S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "viewCount": "97", "dislikeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2008", "q": "10.1002/fee.2008", "items": [{"id": "HDpf0dfQtgY", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCrpY3RRy905oE3SERqJTmBw", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "wikipedia tts", "description": "This is an audio version of the Wikipedia Article:\r\nGame theory\r\n\r\nListening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading.

It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\nGame theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. As of  2014, with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole, eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of game theory to biology.", "title": "Game theory | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-27T06:05:53Z", "tags": ["artificial intelligence", "formal sciences", "game theory", "john von neumann", "mathematical economics", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H1M56S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "65", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2008", "q": "10.1002/fee.2008", "items": [{"id": "2hdF02c8Hrw", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Audiopedia", "channelId": "UCV63FScHnShoobfaENC8R_Q", "description": "A solar cell (also called a photovoltaic cell) is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:\n\nSelf-archiving - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.\nOpen access journal: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.\nOpen access journal funded by article processing charges paid by authors or research sponsor - gold\nOpen access journal funded by an academic institution, learned society or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum, diamond, or gold\nDelayed open-access journals - provide open access after an embargo period, typically 6\u201312 months or longer\nHybrid open access journals at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication feeAdvantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals.

Having these disorders come at a great personal cost to the individual, their families and broader society. This presentation will explore factors contributing to the development of both disorders beginning with early childhood environment, attachment and parenting styles. It will also explore the role of culture and society in perpetuating or curtailing these disorders and the cost and toll on our society and family.

Other mismatches occur when the time scales over which the system responds are much longer than time scales over which actions are typically taken. Concrete examples range from the dynamics of diseases to insect outbreaks to issues related to global change. Various approaches are being developed to deal with these issues based on ideas from dynamical systems, but much more work is needed to understand dynamics, especially when the effects of changing external inputs are included leading to nonautonomous systems. I will present a number of concrete examples ranging from small scales (coral-algal-grazer systems) to larger scales and use these to illustrate and motivate a presentation of current understanding of dynamical systems modeling ecological systems on intermediate time scales. I will specifically consider management questions and will also present results illustrating the complexities introduced by considering explicit time dependence.\n \n\nAlan M.

To produce affordable devices, low material and production costs are crucial. Therefore, inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials in combination with proven paper-making technologies is use to produce super capacitors. The idea is to use low-cost materials like graphite and paper as active and passive components in the devices. In this study, we developed a sustainable and \ufb02exible electrode by using the of\ufb01ce waste paper \ufb01bers reduced graphene oxide-manganese dioxide (PF-RGO-MnO2) \ufb01lm. The PFs with light weight, hygroscopic, and porous properties are not only served as a great low-cost and \ufb02exible substrate but also important to improve the ion diffusion and electron transfer rate between the electrodes and electrolytes. Mono-dispersed of PFs are obtained from the of\ufb01ce waste paper with ultra-sonication, wash, and activation procedure. As a result, owing to the excellent mechanical \ufb02exibility of PFs, great electrical conductivity of RGO sheets, and high electro-activity of MnO2-nanowires, the as-prepared hybrid PFRGOMnO2 electrode exhibits excellent rate capability and high speci\ufb01c capacitance of 410 F g\u22121 at 0.8 A g\u22121. The assembled solid-state symmetric supercapacitors exhibit high energy density (19.6 Wh kg\u22121 at 400 W kg\u22121) and excellent cycling stability of 85.3% retention even after 2000 folding and bending cycles. The development of an alternative super capacitor electrode material from waste paper serves two main purposes that are helps with waste disposal; converting waste to a useful product and provides an economic argument for the substantiality of super capacitor technology.", "title": "NACES2019:TVC_Sustainable and Flexible Super Capacitor based on Office Waste Paper_USM_Team1", "publishedAt": "2019-09-09T13:40:10Z"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4M57S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "0", "viewCount": "57", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2014", "q": "10.1002/fee.2014", "items": [{"id": "uw4rA4FXNyI", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCcQQrZp97sAOZT2NLn8jw7w", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "ICOPLAST Confederation", "description": "webinar on trigger finger; treatment, surgery, conservative, etiology\nRSTN\nexperts in the field teaching hands-on knowledge", "title": "trigger finger webinar, the uncut version", "publishedAt": "2019-02-13T16:03:31Z", "tags": ["#plasticsurgery #teaching #handsurgery #webinar #CME #icoplast"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H56M23S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "viewCount": "109", "dislikeCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2014", "q": "10.1002/fee.2014", "items": [{"id": "2PcbbkBLKKA", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "ABA Inside Track", "channelId": "UCH12WN8z-cyIRPXxdI8WlTg", "description": "We all live in an interconnected, WiFi world.

Does it matter whether you go to a private or public university? Does college prestige matter for a PhD? \nAfter listening to the Dave Ramsey Show - Who is thoroughly brilliant in most aspects of personal finances - this is a question that I think could be better explained than the perspective he gives. \nThe rationale he gives is that the prestige of a university does not matter for college, graduate school, becoming a physician, or obtaining a terminal degree. The logic is that most people that you see in the upper echelons of organizations do not have a private school education, and thus the private school education has no value than the public school education. It is a far more complicated than that.\n\n1. First, generally, the evidence in the academic literature is opposite from this suggestion. We often use university attainment, and college prestige has a control variable when we look at the performance of firms. Indeed, several studies indicate that top managers from elite universities perform better as managers and that the command a higher compensation package (Miller et al., 2014; Datta & Iskandar-Datta, 2014; King et al., 2016).\n\nWhat could you gain from attending an elite university? Signaling effects - the benefit of demonstrating to others that you are quality, social capital - the benefit from relationships, and human capital - added benefit from an increase in skill.\nWhat gives? Is there a justification for either of these arguments?\n1. Often, there is little academic discussion on the returns of prestige university education on firm performance. It might be the case that the costs of the prestigious education might outweigh the benefit of firm performance.\n2. The sample that Dave Ramsey selects from is fundamentally different than a controlled study. Because there are more people that go to public universities, than there is likely going to be more at the tails of there distribution that might become a member of a top management team. The overall performance and success rate of getting a private education (ie. the human capital) might be higher, but there is likely going to be more people that do well from public education.\n3. These studies are correlational. It is extremely difficult to get causal effects in either form of study. For example, you would have to observe a return on investment by attending an elite university, and you would have to see an effect for each semester of education. In order to do so, you would have to duplicate yourself, and send one of you to one university and the other to another, and observe its effects over the long run.\n\nReferences \nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smj.2251\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0a2d/feceed75455266d73a73affb517f972542db.pdf\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothy_King7/publication/290788610_What%27s_in_an_education_Implications_of_CEO_education_for_bank_performance/links/57038fad08aedbac12706b06/Whats-in-an-education-Implications-of-CEO-education-for-bank-performance.pdf\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smj.2631\n\nCheck out:\n\n\nMicro Versus Macro Debates In Business Administration - Nerd-out Wednesday\nhttps://youtu.be/GtduOg0jnAw\n\nWhy You Should Not Learn (Only) From Success - Nerd-out Wednesday\nhttps://youtu.be/ckL9l1wG6pg\n\nLinear Relationships And Curvilinear Associations In Business Research - Nerd-out Wednesday\nhttps://youtu.be/OOnXwO--kvc\n\nPhD Research Topics In Strategic Management - Thesis Proposal - Nerd-out Wednesdays\nhttps://youtu.be/ERLRKcUGe60\n\n\nWhere To Start With Your Where To Start With Your Research Topics In A PhD? -  Monday Writes\nhttps://youtu.be/qbD920bPNFs\n\nStages Of A PhD Dissertation - PhD Timeline - Monday Writes\nhttps://youtu.be/Tonp79Ouj5c\n\nTips On Editing A Dissertation - Monday Writes\nhttps://youtu.be/f3mYAE7XEqU\n\n\n***************\n\nDavid Maslach is a research professor of entrepreneurship, innovation, and business strategy, I discuss topics, such as behavioral science, strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and apply these to my new peer proofreading and editing platform.

Explosives and war materials kill animals, and valuable wildlife products like ivory finance militias. However, the most devastating effects of conflict on wildlife are driven by societal upheaval. War triggers a domino effect of institutional, economic, and social changes that can wreak havoc on the environment. \n\nDuring wartime, law enforcement breaks down, food security is compromised, and livelihoods are upended. This upheaval can drive the exploitation of wildlife and other natural resources. In rare cases, war can be beneficial to wildlife\u2014as people flee militarized regions, they leave behind wildlife \u201crefuges.\u201d But these positive outcomes are few and far between, and are often accompanied by negative outcomes in another place or time.\n\nIn a recent publication in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, we review case studies from around the world to understand the links between war and wildlife. How, exactly, does war affect animal habitats and populations? For a given conflict, understanding these processes is a critical first step towards conservation during and after wartime. \n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.1433/full\n\n\n----\nPHOTO CREDITS\nJ.

That\u2019s the official US Government guidelines - 3 serves of dairy every day and you\u2019ll get all the calcium your body needs. \n\nBut where does that number really come from? And is it possible that the U.S. Government\u2019s dietary guidelines are\u2026 corrupt?\n\n[sciq swoosh]\n\nAs it turns out, milk is one of the last things we need. This really frustrates me  because coming from the world of marketing and advertising. I used to work for the milk industry and i know how much money they pay to lobby the government. So ,if you ever suspected the government is corrupt i can verify that.\n\nHere\u2019s something to remember for any food you eat for their vitamins and minerals: eating a food rich in a nutrient doesn\u2019t matter unless that nutrient is actually absorbed by your body . I could drink liquid iron all day long: if it doesn\u2019t get absorbed into by body it won\u2019t do a thing for my health, except cause a lot of permanent damage to my mouth or, more likely, kill me very quickly - Viserys Targaryen style.\n\nPoint is, milk is very rich in calcium but that doesn\u2019t mean it helps strengthen our bones. In fact, milk may actually lower our \u201cbone mineral density\u201d which may explain why there\u2019s more hip fractures in the elderly living in the western world where milk consumption is high, compared to Eastern asian cultures that don\u2019t drink much milk. So much for milk helping bones get strong! \n\nNow, there is even an hypothesis that milk draws calcium out of the bones. What the hell, milk? I trusted you with my calcium! Here\u2019s what they think is going on: milk is acidic, it is about 6.5 on the ph scale. Acid freaks the body out and it scrambles to neutralize the acidic so it doesn\u2019t get all the way to the kidneys, and to do that it ends up sacrificing calcium from bones. \n\nNow, your body does need calcium. BUT we don\u2019t have to get our calcium from dairy. We can get our calcium needs from:leafy greens, tofu, broccoli, snap peas, almonds, canned fish with bones, leeks, green onions, endive, fennel, cabbage, butternut squash, artichokes, brussel sprouts, sweet potato, parsnips, lima beans, carrots, and turnips). So why do the U.S. guidelines emphasize dairy?\n\nWell, the answer is - money. The US govt is heavily influenced by the dairy industry. And as i said I used to work for the dairy industry at my previous PR agency back in 2014. Remember the \u201cGot Milk?\u201d campaign - yeah I helped promote that. That was back before I started ScIQ, and I'm doing ScIQ as kind of a penance for all the bad things Ive done as a PR agent.  Anyway, the dairy industry know damn well you don\u2019t *need* all that milk, but all that lobbying got the US Government to endorse milk in their official guidelines. Years later, we all kind of accept that milk is essential, even though it\u2019s not! \n\nSo let\u2019s be clear here \u2013 the U.S. dietary guidelines, which gives meat and dairy a big chunk of the food plate \u2013 are NOT the unbiased recommendation of scientists. That is literally a pyramid scheme where get you to buy more eggs, milk, cheese and yogurt. If you want find out more about Big Dairy and the effects they have on the government, check out the links in the description. \n\nWhat do you guys think I know the dairy Industry is just one of the many sources of government lobbying. Is there a particular industry sector or group that you think is lobbying the government you would like us to explore. Let us know in the comments below. \n\nHI everyone!

Other mismatches occur when the time scales over which the system responds are much longer than time scales over which actions are typically taken. Concrete examples range from the dynamics of diseases to insect outbreaks to issues related to global change. Various approaches are being developed to deal with these issues based on ideas from dynamical systems, but much more work is needed to understand dynamics, especially when the effects of changing external inputs are included leading to nonautonomous systems. I will present a number of concrete examples ranging from small scales (coral-algal-grazer systems) to larger scales and use these to illustrate and motivate a presentation of current understanding of dynamical systems modeling ecological systems on intermediate time scales. I will specifically consider management questions and will also present results illustrating the complexities introduced by considering explicit time dependence.\n\n\nAlan Hastings\nUniversity of California, Davis, U.S.\n\n\nSession Chair: Ami Radunskaya, Pomona College, U.S.\n\n\nThis virtual plenary talk was originally scheduled for the 2020 SIAM Conference on Life Sciences.

Specifically, it is \"the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers\". An alternative term suggested \"as a more descriptive name for the discipline\" is interactive decision theory. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science, and biology. The subject first addressed zero-sum games, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants. Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science, including both humans and non-humans (e.g. computers).\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\n\n\nThis video is targeted to blind users.\n\nAttribution:\nArticle text available under CC-BY-SA\nCreative Commons image source in video", "title": "Game theory", "publishedAt": "2014-07-19T10:16:58Z"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H4M4S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "17", "viewCount": "4008", "dislikeCount": "2", "commentCount": "4", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2014", "q": "10.1002/fee.2014", "items": [{"id": "KFvb_mluq8Y", "snippet": {"defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "channelId": "UCwgKmJM4ZJQRJ-U5NjvR2dg", "defaultLanguage": "en", "channelTitle": "commaai archive", "description": "Date of stream 25 Mar 2020.\r\nLive-stream chat added as Subtitles/CC - English (Twitch Chat).\r\nStream title: \rcoronavirus stream 5 #lockdown\n\r\nVideo archive:\r\n- https://youtube.com/commaaiarchive/playlists\r\nSource files:\r\n- https://github.com/geohot/corona\nFollow for notifications:\r\n- https://twitch.tv/georgehotz\r\nSubscribe to support:\r\n- https://twitch.tv/products/tomcr00s3_3000\r\n- https://twitch.tv/products/georgehotz_3000\r\nGeorge Hotz Gear:\r\n- Happy Hacking Keyboard\r\n- Blue Yeti Microphone\r\n- MacBook Pro 16-inch\r\n- tmux & Vim and other\r\n- https://github.com/geohot/configuration\n\nWe are not affiliated with comma.ai.\nOfficial communication channels:\n- https://comma.ai\n- https://twitter.com/comma_ai\n- https://youtube.com/commaai\n- https://medium.com/@comma_ai\n- https://github.com/commaai\n- https://discord.comma.ai\n\nHow to get a job:\n- https://comma.ai/jobs\nHow to collaborate:\n- https://comma.ai/services\nBuy things to support comma.ai:\n- https://comma.ai/shop\n\nAre you interested in openpilot?\nKnowledge base:\n- https://wiki.comma.ai\nCheck out the code:\n- https://openpilot.comma.ai\nIs my car supported?\n- https://comma.ai/vehicles\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n- https://comma.ai/faq\nHow to setup openpilot:\n- https://comma.ai/setup\nComma Secure Shell:\n- https://ssh.comma.ai\nAPI Documentation:\n- https://api.comma.ai\nCAN analysis tool: \n- https://cabana.comma.ai\nReview and annotate your driving data:\n- https://my.comma.ai\nLeaderboard\n- https://my.comma.ai/leaderboard\nComma Connect App:\n- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889\n- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect\nResearch:\n- https://github.com/commaai/comma2k19\n- https://github.com/commaai/comma10k\n- https://github.com/commaai/research\n\nWe archive George Hotz and comma.ai videos for fun.\nFollow for notifications:  \n- https://twitter.com/commaaiarchive\nUnofficial communities and resources:\n- https://reddit.com/r/comma_ai\n- https://reddit.com/r/geohot\n- https://community.comma.ai/wiki\n- https://commasupport.zendesk.com\n\nThank you for reading and using the SHOW MORE button.\nWe hope you enjoy watching George's videos as much as we do.\nSee you at the next video.", "title": "George Hotz | Programming | coronavirus stream 5 #lockdown part5 | COVID-19", "publishedAt": "2020-03-26T16:19:27Z", "tags": ["programming", "livecoding", "georgehotz", "self", "driving", "autonomous", "advanced", "driver", "assist", "system", "ADAS", "CAN", "bus", "cars", "george", "hotz", "geohot", "comma.ai", "panda", "openpilot", "eon", "chffr", "cabana", "giraffe", "comma", "pedal", "explorer", "twitch", "github", "periscope", "twitter", "yt:cc=on"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT4H14M19S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "539", "viewCount": "46702", "dislikeCount": "18", "commentCount": "224", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2014", "q": "10.1002/fee.2014", "items": [{"id": "PeOViy38zUg", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Audiopedia", "channelId": "UCV63FScHnShoobfaENC8R_Q", "description": "ISO 14000 is a family of standards related to environmental management that exists to help organizations (a) minimize how their operations (processes, etc.) negatively affect the environment (i.e., cause adverse changes to air, water, or land); (b) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements, and (c) continually improve in the above.\nISO 14000 is similar to ISO 9000 quality management in that both pertain to the process of how a product is produced, rather than to the product itself.

They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to obtain a closed-form expression, or infeasible to apply a deterministic algorithm. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimization, numerical integration and generation of draws from a probability distribution.\nIn physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are quite useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs, such as the calculation of risk in business; and, in math, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions.

The city is also the capital of the surrounding county of Tirana, one of 12 constituent counties of the country. By air, it is 501 kilometres (311 miles) north of Athens, 613 kilometres (381 miles) southeast of Rome, 153 kilometres (95 miles) southwest of Skopje and 131 kilometres (81 miles) south of Podgorica.\nTirana was founded as a city in 1614, but the region that today corresponds to the city territory has been continuously inhabited since the Bronze Age. As most of Albania, the area was populated by several Illyrian tribes, but had no importance within Illyria. Indeed, it was annexed by Rome and became an integral part of the Roman Empire following the Illyrian Wars. The heritage of that period is still evident and represented by the Mosaics of Tirana. Further later in the 5th and 6th century, a Paleo Christian basilica was built around this site. \nWhen the Roman Empire divided into east and west, its successor the Byzantine Empire took control and included the construction of the Petrel\u00eb Castle, under the reign of Justinian I. Until the 20th century, the city did not attain much significance, when the Congress of Lushnj\u00eb proclaimed it as the country's capital, after the country's declaration of independence in 1912.\nTirana is located in the center of the country surrounded by mountains and hills, with Dajt on the east and a slight valley opening on the northwest, overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. Due to its location within the Tirana plain and the close proximity to the Adriatic Sea, the city is influenced by a mediterranean seasonal climate. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.Being a primate city, Tirana is considered the economic and cultural hub of Albania, due to its significant location and importance in finance, commerce, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education, service, research and healthcare. All of the country's largest companies, media and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Tirana is also the seat of power of the Government of Albania, the residences for work of the President and Prime Minister of Albania.", "title": "Tirana | Wikipedia audio article", "publishedAt": "2018-11-29T12:08:08Z", "tags": ["capitals in europe", "cities in albania", "tirana", "wikipedia audio article", "learning by listening", "improves your listening skills", "learn while on the move", "reduce eye strain", "text to speech"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT56M20S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "viewCount": "97", "dislikeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0"}}]}, {"idx_paper": "10.1002/fee.2014", "q": "10.1002/fee.2014", "items": [{"id": "HdNTwozZdCA", "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Audiopedia", "channelId": "UCV63FScHnShoobfaENC8R_Q", "description": "Competitive advantage occurs when an organization acquires or develops an attribute or combination of attributes that allows it to outperform its competitors.

Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, and monographs.Academic articles (as historically seen in paper-based academic journals) have been the main focus of the movement. Conventional (non-open access) journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. Open access research is advanced by a range of distribution mechanisms and business models. These include:\n\nSelf-archiving - green: After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a web site controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.\nOpen access journal: The publisher of the journal makes all articles and related content available for free on the journal's web site.\nOpen access journal funded by article processing charges paid by authors or research sponsor - gold\nOpen access journal funded by an academic institution, learned society or a government information center (no publication fees are paid by authors) - platinum, diamond, or gold\nDelayed open-access journals - provide open access after an embargo period, typically 6\u201312 months or longer\nHybrid open access journals at least partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication feeAdvantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals.
