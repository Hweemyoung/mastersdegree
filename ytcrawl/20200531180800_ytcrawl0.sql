To obtain an edge in a highly competitive environment, the analyst needs to proper fine-tune its strategy, or discover how to combine weak signals in novel alpha creating manners. Both aspects, namely fine-tuning and combination, have been extensively researched using several methods, but emerging techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks can have an impact into such aspects. Therefore, our work proposes the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for trading strategies calibration and aggregation. To this purpose, we provide a full methodology on: (i) the training and selection of a cGAN for time series data; (ii) how each sample is used for strategies calibration; and (iii) how all generated samples can be used for ensemble modelling. To provide evidence that our approach is well grounded, we have designed an experiment with multiple trading strategies, encompassing 579 assets. We compared cGAN with an ensemble scheme and model validation methods, both suited for time series. Our results suggest that cGANs are a suitable alternative for strategies calibration and combination, providing outperformance when the traditional techniques fail to generate any alpha', '2019-03-13 14:41:46', 'machinelearning, finance, trading, networks', NULL, NULL, 'UCL Financial Computing', 'UCAQMZUQYgeQ-s_Cal_O_WNw', '2688', '422', '9', '0', '1', '0', 0, 'paper_explanation', '74', 'arxiv.org/abs/1901.01751', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

When the agents can only acquire partial observations and are faced with tasks requiring coordination and synchronisation skills, inter-agent communication plays an essential role. In this work, we propose a framework for multi-agent training using deep deterministic policy gradients that enables concurrent, end-to-end learning of an explicit communication protocol through a memory device. During training, the agents learn to perform read and write operations enabling them to infer a shared representation of the world. We empirically demonstrate that concurrent learning of the communication device and individual policies can improve inter-agent coordination and performance in small-scale systems. We illustrate how different communication patterns can emerge on six different tasks of increasing complexity. Furthermore, we study the effects of corrupting the communication channel, provide a visualisation of the time-varying memory content as the underlying task is being solved and validate the building blocks of the proposed memory device through ablation studies.', '2019-10-25 10:31:12', 'Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent, Communication, AI', NULL, NULL, 'Data Science Group WMG', 'UCkDyucGZSYrSbBefntPZVHg', '46', '54', '0', '0', '0', '0', 0, 'paper_supplementary', '150', 'arxiv.org/abs/1901.03887', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

All the other competing methods, be it kernel machines, or random forests, do not have this capability. Moreover, optimisation (SGD) lies at the heart of representation learning in the sense that it allows finding good representations.\n\nWhat really improves the training quality of a neural network?\nWe discussed about the accuracy of neural networks depending pretty much on how good the Stochastic Gradient Descent method is at finding minima of the loss function. What would influence such minima?Stan\'s answer has revealed that training set accuracy or loss value is not that interesting actually. It is relatively easy to overfit data (i.e. achieve the lowest loss possible), provided a large enough network, and a large enough computational budget. However, shape of the minima, or performance on validation sets are in a quite fascinating way influenced by optimisation. Optimisation in the beginning of the trajectory, steers such trajectory towards minima of certain properties that go much further than just training accuracy.\nAs always we spoke about the future of AI and the role deep learning will play.\nI hope you enjoy the show!\nDon\'t forget to join the conversation on our new Discord channel.

This modern version of Dijkstra\'s shortest path algorithm is outperforming everything else by orders of magnitude, and all based on random exploration.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10995\nhttps://eng.uber.com/go-explore/\nhttps://github.com/uber-research/go-explore\n\nAbstract:\nA grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma\'s Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma\'s Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on Montezuma\'s Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of "superhuman" performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics).\n\nAuthors: Adrien Ecoffet, Joost Huizinga, Joel Lehman, Kenneth O.

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.\n\nAuthors: Taco S.

Zico Kolter\n\nAbstract: Aimed at explaining the surprisingly good generalization behavior of overparameterized deep networks, recent works have developed a variety of generalization bounds for deep learning,  all  based on the fundamental learning-theoretic technique of uniform convergence. While\nit is well-known that many of these existing bounds are numerically large, through numerous experiments, we bring to light a more concerning aspect of these bounds: in practice,  these bounds can {\\em increase} with the training dataset size. Guided by our observations,\nwe then present examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by  gradient descent (GD) where uniform convergence provably cannot ``explain generalization\'\' -- even if we take into account the implicit bias of GD {\\em to the fullest extent possible}.  More precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by SGD that have test errors less than some small , applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers yields a generalization guarantee that is larger than 1 and is therefore nearly vacuous. Through these findings, we cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based generalization bounds to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized deep networks generalize well. \n=========', '2019-10-27 17:29:59', 'deep learning, generalization, learning theory', NULL, NULL, 'CMU Locus Lab', 'UCFq0sKBQodUIjS3qjaXCYjg', '172', '2114', '28', '0', '0', '0', 0, 'paper_explanation', '1788', 'arxiv.org/abs/1902.04742', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

They exploit certain anomalies that adversarial attacks introduce, in particular if they follow the paradigm of choosing perturbations optimally under p-norm constraints. Access to the log-odds is the only requirement to defend models. We justify our approach empirically, but also provide conditions under which detectability via the suggested test statistics is guaranteed to be effective.

This task structure arises in interpretation problems where an agent receives a complex input, such as a natural language command, and needs to generate a complex response, such as an action sequence, but only receives binary success-failure feedback. Rewards of this kind are usually underspecified because they do not distinguish between purposeful and accidental success. To learn in these scenarios, effective exploration is critical to find successful trajectories, but generalization also depends on discounting spurious trajectories that achieve accidental success. We address exploration by using a mode covering direction of KL divergence to collect a diverse set of successful trajectories, followed by a mode seeking KL divergence to train a robust policy. We address reward underspecification by using Meta-Learning and Bayesian Optimization to construct an auxiliary reward function, which provides more accurate feedback for learning. The parameters of the auxiliary reward function are optimized with respect to the validation performance of the trained policy.

Program analysis is also used to ensure complex software adheres to standards and regulations (e.g., medical devices, car industry, and aviation industry).\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the three main properties that enable program analyses to be useful in practice: scalability, precision, and usability. I will relate that to various papers that have been published in the field of program analysis, as well as some of the work that my group has done.

Like AlphaZero and replications such as ELF OpenGo and Leela Zero, the KataGo bot only learns from neural-net-guided Monte Carlo tree search self-play. But whereas AlphaZero required thousands of TPUs over several days and ELF required thousands of GPUs over two weeks, KataGo surpasses ELFs final model after only 19 days on fewer than 30 GPUs. Much of the speedup involves non-domain-specific improvements that might directly transfer to other problems.

Many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic motivation to complement the sparse extrinsic reward signal, giving the agent more opportunities to receive feedback during exploration. Most commonly, these signals are added as bonus rewards, which results in the mixture policy faithfully conducting neither exploration nor task fulfillment for an extended amount of time. In this paper, we instead learn separate intrinsic and extrinsic task policies and schedule between these different drives to accelerate exploration and stabilize learning. Moreover, we introduce a new type of intrinsic reward denoted as successor feature control (SFC), which is general and not task-specific. It takes into account statistics over complete trajectories and thus differs from previous methods that only use local information to evaluate intrinsic motivation. We evaluate our proposed scheduled intrinsic drive (SID) agent using three different environments with pure visual inputs: VizDoom, DeepMind Lab and OpenAI Gym classic control from pixels. The results show a greatly improved exploration efficiency with SFC and the hierarchical usage of the intrinsic drives.', '2019-03-16 15:10:30', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Jingwei Zhang', 'UCQE2omNXJ1ZvjfvPTvj7hHw', '184', '177', '3', '0', '0', '0', 0, 'paper_supplementary', '2557', 'arxiv.org/abs/1903.07400', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

Le, Cameron Voloshin, Yisong Yue\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nAbstract:  When learning policies for real-world domains, two important questions arise: (i) how to efficiently use pre-collected off-policy, non-optimal behavior data; and (ii) how to mediate among different competing objectives and constraints. We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints, and offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm that admits any batch reinforcement learning and online learning procedure as subroutines. We then present a specific algorithmic instantiation and provide performance guarantees for the main objective and all constraints. To certify constraint satisfaction, we propose a new and simple method for off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and derive PAC-style bounds. Our algorithm achieves strong empirical results in different domains, including in a challenging problem of simulated car driving subject to multiple constraints such as lane keeping and smooth driving. We also show experimentally that our OPE method outperforms other popular OPE techniques on a standalone basis, especially in a high-dimensional setting.', '2019-03-22 05:53:10', 'Machine learning, Reinforcement Learning, Batch Policy Learning, Constrained Policy Learning', NULL, NULL, 'Hoang Le', 'UC4TKZ-kqyaw-ApUnSYpagyw', '762', '335', '9', '0', '2', '0', 0, 'paper_explanation', '2671', 'arxiv.org/abs/1903.08738', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

Rupam Mahmood, Gautham Vasan, James Bergstra, (2019).\n\nThe full paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11524\n\nReinforcement learning algorithms rely on exploration to discover new behaviors, which is typically achieved by following a stochastic policy. In continuous control tasks, policies with a Gaussian distribution have been widely adopted. Gaussian exploration however does not result in smooth trajectories that generally correspond to safe and rewarding behaviors in practical tasks. In addition, Gaussian policies do not result in an effective exploration of an environment and become increasingly inefficient as the action rate increases. This contributes to a low sample efficiency often observed in learning continuous control tasks. We introduce a family of stationary autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes to facilitate exploration in continuous control domains. We show that proposed processes possess two desirable features: subsequent process observations are temporally coherent with continuously adjustable degree of coherence, and the process stationary distribution is standard normal. We derive an autoregressive policy (ARP) that implements such processes maintaining the standard agent-environment interface. We show how ARPs can be easily used with the existing off-the-shelf learning algorithms. Empirically we demonstrate that using ARPs results in improved exploration and sample efficiency in both simulated and real world domains, and, furthermore, provides smooth exploration trajectories that enable safe operation of robotic hardware.', '2019-03-27 19:25:26', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Kindred AI', 'UCjeevuqcVsC5o-Kgc6QaCVQ', '170', '990', '19', '2', '2', '0', 0, 'paper_supplementary', '2884', 'arxiv.org/abs/1903.11524', '2020-05-30 10:09:17'),

This procedure often suffers from exploiting inaccuracies of the learned model. We propose to regularize trajectory optimization by means of a denoising autoencoder that is trained on the same trajectories as the model of the environment. We show that the proposed regularization leads to improved planning with both gradient-based and gradient-free optimizers. We also demonstrate that using regularized trajectory optimization leads to rapid initial learning in a set of popular motor control tasks, which suggests that the proposed approach can be a useful tool for improving sample efficiency.\n\nAuthors: Rinu Boney, Norman Di Palo, Mathias Berglund, Alexander Ilin, Juho Kannala, Antti Rasmus, Harri Valpola\n\nLinks:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ykilcher\nBitChute: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/yannic-kilcher\nMinds: https://www.minds.com/ykilcher', '2020-05-24 15:31:04', 'deep learning, machine learning, arxiv, explained, neural networks, ai, artificial intelligence, paper, rl, reinforcement learning, model predictive control, dae, denoising autoencoders, trajectory, trajectory optimization, planning, adversarial attack, errors, open loop, closed loop, joint, probability, derivative, gaussian, experience, learned model, world model, model predictive, mpc', 'en', 'en-US', 'Yannic Kilcher', 'UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew', '1798', '1896', '95', '1', '18', '0', 0, 'paper_explanation', '2914', 'arxiv.org/abs/1903.11981', '2020-05-30 10:09:18'),

However, they often produce blurry images, which is linked to their training objective. Sampling in the most popular implementation, the Gaussian VAE, can be interpreted as simply injecting noise to the input of a deterministic decoder. In practice, this simply enforces a smooth latent space structure. We challenge the adoption of the full VAE framework on this specific point in favor of a simpler, deterministic one. Specifically, we investigate how substituting stochasticity with other explicit and implicit regularization schemes can lead to a meaningful latent space without having to force it to conform to an arbitrarily chosen prior. To retrieve a generative mechanism for sampling new data points, we propose to employ an efficient ex-post density estimation step that can be readily adopted both for the proposed deterministic autoencoders as well as to improve sample quality of existing VAEs. We show in a rigorous empirical study that regularized deterministic autoencoding achieves state-of-the-art sample quality on the common MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.\n\ncitation:\n@inproceedings{ghosh2020from,\ntitle={From Variational to Deterministic Autoencoders},\nauthor={Partha Ghosh and Mehdi S.

Zico Kolter\n\nAbstract:\nWe cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based generalization bounds to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized deep networks generalize well. While it is well-known that many existing bounds are numerically large, through a variety of experiments, we first bring to light another crucial and more concerning aspect of these bounds: in practice, these bounds can {\\em increase} with the dataset size. Guided by our observations, we then present examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where uniform convergence provably cannot `explain generalization, even if we take into account implicit regularization {\\em to the fullest extent possible}. More precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by SGD that have test errors less than some small , applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers yields a generalization guarantee that is larger than 1 and is therefore nearly vacuous.', '2020-03-09 02:20:00', '9-03-2020', NULL, NULL, 'AI Pursuit - Angus Tay', 'UCe_QLqna7cFtTCfZ0a8pycg', '1138', '239', '11', '0', '1', '0', 0, NULL, '1788', 'arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04742.pdf', '2020-05-30 10:09:18'),

We used methods based on convolutional neural network to model the spatial evolution of multiple brain regions separately.  Convolutional neural networks are methods used for data analysis and are especially relevant for image analysis. More precisely, we generated the images used variational auto-encoders. This deep learning simulation shows that the brain regions, such as the hippocampus, the medial and inferior temporal gyri, the amygdala, the anterior temporal lobe, etc, are affected at different degrees. This method can be used to evaluate the performance of event-based models (EBM), a class of disease progression models that can be used to estimate temporal ordering of neuropathological changes from cross-sectional data. This model was optimized using data from 1737 subjects from the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In the article below, we use the simulation method to evaluate a novel method that exploits high-dimensional voxel-wise imaging biomarkers: n-dimensional discriminative EBM. In the future this methodological development could aid improve the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\'s disease and contribute to a more efficient disease prevention.\n\nFor the international conference IPMI, held in Hong Kong.\n\n\nThe full article is available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03386.pdf\nTo get the latest news: https://twitter.com/fpgDubost \nTo see all our publications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_yNBmx8AAAAJ&hl=fr\nPersonal website (under construction): https://floriandubost.com\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-dubost-11b60a6a/ \nResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florian_Dubost', '2019-08-25 11:51:09', 'deep learning, dementia, alzheimer, autoencoder, varitonal autoencoder, machine learning, neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_cpXuriimXpQeom8JrqGeg?view_as=subscriber', NULL, 'en', 'Florian Dubost', 'UC_cpXuriimXpQeom8JrqGeg', '89', '117', '2', '0', '0', '0', 0, NULL, '2243', 'arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03386.pdf', '2020-05-30 10:09:18'),
