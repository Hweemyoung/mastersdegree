Dr. Gulia-Nuss's research focuses on understanding the basic biology of ticks in order to identify novel targets for tick control. Her long-term goal is to develop novel strategies to control ticks and tick-borne disease transmission. To this end, she is generating first-ever transgenic ticks using CRISPR-Cas gene-editing system and employing other cutting-edge genomic techniques such as Hi-C based genome scaffolding for better assembly and annotation of the tick genome. Her current work focuses on understanding the role of insulin signaling in tick-pathogen interactions and differences in chemoreception circuit in different Ixodes species. Understanding tick- pathogen interactions and genes involved in host seeking are vital to development of novel disease transmission control strategies.\n\nWebinar:\nChicago\u00ae and Dovetail\u2122 Hi-C yield chromosome length scaffolds of the Ixodes scapularis genome\n\nWebinar Abstract:\nIxodes scapularis is the principal vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. I. scapularis genome was the first and only medically important acarine species sequenced and annotated thus far. The genome was sequenced using BAC clones and Sanger sequencing methods. However, the 2.1 Gb haploid genome with long repetitive sequencing posed challenge to achieve scaffolds that span entire chromosomes. Some repetitive regions were too large and difficult to be spanned by the available clone libraries. The assembly, IscaW1, comprises 369,495 scaffolds representing 57% of the genome. The fragmented genome further poses challenges in identifying gene sequences and therefore a high-quality genome sequence is needed for advance genomics and genetics work in this vector.\nThe availability of sequencing methods that could produce scaffold size sequence length and three-dimensional chromatin capture such as PacBio, and Dovetail\u2122 Hi-C, respectively, are changing the genome sequencing landscape. Hi-C is a sequencing-based approach for determining how a genome is folded by measuring the frequency of contact between pairs of loci. Dovetail\u2122 Hi-C data can provide links across a variety of length scales, spanning even whole chromosomes and this technique has been used to improve draft genome assemblies and to create chromosome-length scaffolds for large genomes. We therefore used the Dovetail\u2122 Hi-C technique to achieve chromosomal level assembly of tick genome. We carried out Chicago\u00ae and Dovetail\u2122 Hi-C assemblies that utilize in vitro and in situ chromatin structures, respectively, in order to provide the best scaffolding success. We successfully assembled the genome in 28 10Mbp sequences that correspond to 28 chromosomes in I. scapularis.\n\nLearning Objective:\n\n\u2022 The value of obtaining a highly contiguous and accurate genome assembly up to chromosome scale for a highly repetitive genome.\n\nEarn PACE Credits:\n1.

Medzhitov explains how Inflammation is generated when pathogens, allergens, or other perturbations are recognized by sensor cells that then release inflammatory mediators (cytokines and chemokines) to activate effector cells. Inflammation is then followed by a resolution phase that brings the system back to homeostasis.\n\nWhy do we experience fatigue and loss of appetite, as well as other symptoms when we get ill? Sometimes what we associate with a pathogenic response and illness is the effect of inflammation. In his second talk, Medzhitov outlines the symptoms that we often feel when we get sick, like the lack of appetite (anorexia), and unveils the molecular mechanisms that explain why we have evolved this way. In addition, he compares and contrasts how anorexia affects the outcome of bacterial and viral infections.\n\nSpeaker Biography:\nDr. Ruslan Medzhitov is a Sterling Professor of immunology at Yale School of Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. His laboratory studies the signals that initiate and control the process of inflammation, allergic reaction, and immune response. His laboratory also studies tissue biology, and the communication circuits that help to establish stable cellular communities within tissues.\n\nMedzhitov earned his bachelor's in Biology from Tashkent State University, and pursued a doctorate degree in biochemistry at the Moscow State University (1993). Medzhitov was a graduate student during the profound economic crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, which prevented him from performing any experimental work during his graduate studies. Being unable to do any experimental work didn\u2019t stop Medzhitov, who continued his studies by reading the scientific literature at the Library for Natural Sciences in Moscow, and attending lectures. There, he encountered his passion towards studying immunology after reading a paper by Dr. Charles Janeway, where he described his theories on how the immune system works. Medzhitov, fascinated by these theories, contacted Janeway and started a collaboration that shaped the rest of his career. In 1993, Medzhitov received a 3-month Unesco fellowship to study bioinformatics with Russell Doolittle at the University of California, San Diego. In 1994, he continued his postdoctoral training at Janeway\u2019s lab. \n\nFor his scientific contributions, Medzhitov was elected member of the National Academy of Sciences (2010), and received the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine (2011).

These data provide molecular, cellular, tissue, organism and population-level information about how drugs work to create both efficacy and adverse events. Any single data source is imperfect, but integration of these sources can yield remarkable and practical discoveries as well as opportunities for application. In this talk, I describe our recent work using informatics technologies to (1) assess the potential impact of pharmacogenomics in the era of personal genome sequencing, (2) analyze the corpus of published medical literature to extract potentially novel drug interactions along with putative mechanisms, and (3) discover a novel drug-drug interaction that may affect up to 1 million Americans. Together these efforts suggest that informatics-driven science can not only create strong hypotheses, but can provide initial validation, and suggest very focused inexpensive experimental validations. \r\n\r\nThe NIH Wednesday Afternoon Lecture Series includes weekly scientific talks by some of the top researchers in the biomedical sciences worldwide. \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit: \r\nThe NIH Director's Wednesday Afternoon Lecture Series  \r\nAuthor:  Russ B.

But with more than 25,000 human genes and more than 6,000,000 common genetic variants mapped in our genome, finding associations between our genotype and phenotype is an ongoing challenge. Indeed, genome-wide association studies have found thousands of small effect size genetic variants that are associated with phenotypic traits and disease. The simplest explanation is that these genetic variants work synergistically to help define phenotype and to regulate processes that are responsible for phenotypic state transitions. We will use gene expression and genetic data to explore gene regulatory networks, to study phenotypic state transitions, and to analyze the connections between genotype, gene expression, and phenotyope, and to explore how cancer-risk SNPs exert an influence on the disease risk that extends beyond one locus.\n\nLearning Objectives: \n1. Genes and genetic variants work together in complex networks that are associated with individual phenotypes and change as phenotype evolves and changes.\n2. Differences in network structure can help us to better understand the drivers of health and disease.\n3. Networks and their structures can help us understand how small-effect genetic variants can work collectively to influence disease risk.\n\nEarn PACE Credits:\n1.

After doing post-doctoral work first at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and then at the University of California, Irvine, he got his first faculty position at Wayne State University in 1985. In 1996 he joined the Mayo Clinic as a full Professor in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. His laboratory studies the common fragile sites which are regions of profound genomic instability that are found in all individuals. His laboratory also studies the various ways that human papillomavirus is involved in the generation of different cancers. Dr. Smith is also the Chairman of the Technology Assessment Group for the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine. The role of this group is to evaluate new technologies that could have a profound impact on basic research and its' clinical translation. The most exciting technology that has the greatest potential to change both research and clinical practice is next generation sequencing and Dr. Smith and his group have been using this technology to answer scientific questions. The advances in next generation sequencing over the past 10 years have been nothing short of incredible and it is now possible to generate terrabases of DNA sequence in a single run of a next generation sequencer. This technology can be utilized in a number of ways from characterizing just a few genes all the way to whole genome sequencing.\n\nWebinar:\nWhole Genome Sequencing As A Valuable Clinical Tool For the Management of Cancer Patients\n\nWebinar Abstract:\nAdvances in DNA sequencing, based upon massively parallel sequencing, has resulted in dramatic advances in DNA sequence output in the past few years. It is now possible to generate terrabases of accurate DNA sequence with a single run on several DNA sequencing platforms. This has then made it possible to characterize alterations that occur during cancer development. Genomic alterations can be characterized by targeted sequencing of genes that are frequently altered during cancer development, by sequencing of the entire exome, transcriptome sequencing, and even by whole genome sequencing. Each of these has their own inherent strengths and weaknesses. I will describe why I believe that the best strategy moving forward for the management of cancer patients is whole genome sequencing (WGS). This can currently be done reliably and inexpensively on two completing platforms. The first is the Illumina sequencing platform and the second is from BGI. WGS is a comprehensive technology that can detect all the alterations in a cancer genome and I will describe how and why this may prove to be the best approach for the management of cancer patients.\n\nEarn PACE/CME Credits:\n1.

Generating hypotheses by analyzing hundreds if not thousands of differentially expressed genes from expression studies and mining information from large amount of publicly available NGS and -omics data can be a very daunting task. QIAGEN\u2019s Oncoland/Arraystudio (from Omicsoft) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software provide with a set of tools and functionalities to do analysis and interpretation of NGS data to generate meaningful hypotheses and the ability to mine and compare information across a very large number of datasets curated from publicly available from sources such as GEO, SRA, TCGA, GTEX and others. In this webinar, we use gene expression data from a clinical study (GSE67501) focused on understanding the mechanism underlying anti-PD-1 therapy failure in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients. Using this data and the data curated from TCGA and other sources, it will be demonstrated how Arraystudio and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis can be used to generate hypotheses for mechanism of action and to discover potential targets and biomarkers.\n\nLearning Objectives: \n1. Introduction to databases backing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Oncoland\n2. Studying potential biomarkers and targets through Oncoland\u2019s data mining and comparison tools\n3. Generation of peer-reviewed literature backed hypotheses through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis\n\nEarn PACE/CME Credits:\n1.

The number of FDA-approved targeted therapies, as well as those entering clinical trials, is continually increasing. In addition, clinical trials based on molecular profiling (\u201cBucket Trials\u201d) are becoming widely available in community oncology practices.\n\nMolecular profiling of tumor tissues allows for comprehensive sequencing of large panels of genes to detect mutations, copy number changes and translocations. Currently, greater than 50 FDA-approved drugs target specific genetic pathways that are altered in cancer, and there are hundreds of clinical trials that are studying the association of targeted therapies in the context of specific genetic alterations. The results are rapidly being incorporated into treatment guidelines issued by the National Cancer Center Network that recommend multiplex next-generation sequencing to identify patients who are most likely to respond to newly approved drugs.\n\nThe KEW Group\u2019s CancerPlex is a DNA-based next-generation sequencing test of GT 400 known cancer genes that includes all genes associated with FDA-approved targeted drugs, as well as drugs in clinical development. The entire coding regions of all genes in the panel are sequenced. Thus, in addition to common genetic variants, Cancerplex detects novel or rare mutations that are missed by other testing modalities. Copy number changes and translocations of ALK, RET and ROS genes are also analyzed in one comprehensive assay.  \n\nGenetic findings are reported in easy to understand, clinically relevant categories based on proprietary genetic variant database with a turnaround time of 7-10 days.

Strains belonging to clonal complex 17 (CC17) are the most frequently responsible for GBS infections in neonates, especially among late-onset disease cases. Therefore, we undertook the largest genomic study of GBS CC17 strains to date to decipher the genetic bases of their remarkable colonization and infection ability. We show that crucial functions involved in different steps of the colonization or infection process of GBS are distinctly mutated during the adaptation of CC17 to the human host. In particular, our results implicate the CovRS two-component regulator of virulence in the differentiation between carriage- and disease-associated isolates. Not only does this work raise important implications for the ongoing development of a vaccine against GBS but might also drive the discovery of key functions for GBS adaptation and pathogenesis that have been overlooked until now.\n\nAuthors:  Alexandre Almeida\nIsabelle Rosinski-Chupin\nC\u00e9line Plainvert \nPierre-Emmanuel Douarre\nMaria J.

Deep sequencing has revealed that virtually all environments, including the human body, are teeming with diverse microbial communities. While microbes have predominantly been studied in the context of pathogenicity, it is now evident that the human microbiota contributes biological functions essential to health. Conversely, disrupting the microbiota host homeostasis in healthy individuals can lead to dysbiosis and is associated with many diseases and pathologies.\n As a consequence, research into the human microbiome has started to transform the healthcare landscape providing novel approaches for diagnostics and therapeutics. Other areas benefitting from metagenomics include biological safety of food and water. And in agriculture, changes in soil and in animal microbiomes can now be evaluated in the context of crop yield, livestock health, and reduced dependency on herbicides, pesticides, and antibiotics.\n \nEarn PACE Credits:\n1.

One of the longstanding challenges in infectious disease has been the lack of high-quality reference genomes.  Parasite genomes in particular have been highly fragmented, as the telomeric regions of their chromosomes are dense with highly homologous genes that cannot be resolved with short read sequencing.  Recent developments in genome sequencing, however, are helping researchers overcome this barrier.  Recently, highly contiguous genome assemblies of Plasmodium falciparum, Aedes aegypti, and multiple trypanosomes have become available.  The number of reference genomes for bacteria that cause infectious disease is similarly expanding rapidly. Join Dr. Ashby as she discusses now these new resources are already yielding new biological insights into critical questions in infectious disease research, including how parasites evade the immune system add how pathogens are adapting to evolutionary pressures.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n1. Understand how the structure of parasite genomes facilitates immune evasion and rapid adaptation while at the same time creating challenges for high-quality genome assembly.\n2. Discuss how long-read sequencing and high-quality references facilitate the identification of genomic changes linked to selective pressure, either directly or in conjunction with short read data.\n\nEarn PACE Credits:\n1.

In particular, the number of cells measured by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments has gone from dozens to over a million cells, thanks to improved protocols and fluidic handling. Analysis of such data can provide detailed information on the composition of heterogeneous biological samples, and variety of cellular processes that altogether comprise the cellular state. Such inferences, however, require careful statistical treatment, to take into account measurement noise as well as inherent biological stochasticity. I will discuss several approaches we have developed to address such problems, including error modeling techniques, statistical interrogation of heterogeneity using gene sets, and visualization of complex heterogeneity patterns, implemented in PAGODA package. I will discuss how these approaches have been modified to enable fast analysis of very large datasets in PAGODA2, and how the flow of typical scRNA-seq analysis can be adapted to take advantage of potentially extensive repositories of scRNA-seq measurements. Finally, I will illustrate how such approaches can be used to study transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity in human brains.\n\nJean Fan\nHarvard Medical School, Kharchenko Lab\n\nPrimer: Linking genetic and transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity at the single cell level\n\nFor more information on the Broad Institute and Models, Inference and Algorithms visit: https://www.broadinstitute.org/mia\n\nCopyright Broad Institute, 2017.

A comparative genome and transcriptome analysis of the same sample is a tool to explain changes in the transcriptome by features within genome. In order to avoid a mixed transcription profile from multiple cells, it is necessary to analyze a small cell number. For a detailed analysis of the genome and transcriptome, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a useful method. However, it requires an amount of nucleic acid much higher than that present in a few cells. Therefore, whole genome amplification (WGA) and whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) is prerequisite for NGS. \n\nHere, we describe how the genome and the transcriptome can be amplified simultaneously from a few cells in a highly parallel and comparable process.

Herein, we applied an integrative systems biology workflow to hypothesize clinically relevant biomarkers and drugs targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.1 Our workflow included several in silico approaches that integrate the prioritization of disease gene signatures, the analysis of disease-gene pathways and networks, and the ranking of putative drug targets based on their novelty scores (i.e., evaluating complete novelty, condition novelty or evidence of early development). We foresee this workflow as a universal tool for the prioritization of drug targets and biomarkers in complex diseases including, cancer, diabetes and many neurodiseases.\n\nIn this session, we will be using MetaCore to compare and analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 6 brain regions of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients calculated from the gene expression profiles reported in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE5281.  Next, we will apply Causal Reasoning in MetaCore Key Pathway Advisor (MetaCore KPA) to identify upstream regulatory hubs that could be prioritized as drug targets and/or biomarkers.  The gene and protein hits identified from the upstream key hub predictions and downstream enrichment analyses will be integrated and analyzed using the network building tools available in MetaCore to understand the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the prioritized hypotheses will be evaluated and putative drug targets will be ranked based on their novelty scores, using the Drug Research Advisor-Target Druggability (DRA-TD).2 At the end of this session we will be able to answer the following key questions:\n\n\u2022 What pathways and process networks are potentially disrupted in Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\u2022 What upstream key regulatory hubs are potentially activated or inhibited in Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\u2022 How to integrate results from upstream and downstream analyses to generate higher confidence, clinically-relevant hypotheses about drug targets and biomarkers?\n\u2022 How to evaluate the resulting hypotheses and score putative drug targets?\n\nReferences:\n1) Hajjo, R & Willis, C.
