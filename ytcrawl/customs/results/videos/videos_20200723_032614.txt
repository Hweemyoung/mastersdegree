Classical anatomists recognized that the brain\u2019s component architecture is most accurately seen through the lens of neurodevelopment. This principle has been further applied to understand the brain\u2019s internal connections, capacity for learning, and functional maturation. By drawing together researchers from different fields, this symposium aims to generate healthy discussion and debate on how advances in neurodevelopment have shaped and will continue to shape, our understanding of brain architecture and function, both in health and in psychiatric disorders. \n\nFor more information go to https://nimhbraincircuit.com \n \nAuthor: National Institute of Mental Health, NIH  \n\nPermanent link:  https://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?27216", "channelId": "UCgyzPgagPZxXM8dOAjE9B2w", "title": "Developmental Origins of Brain Circuit Architecture and Psychiatric Disorders (Day 2)", "tags": ["NIH"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT7H35M38S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "28", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "1244", "dislikeCount": "1"}, "id": "SCCSw6mM8fo"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu361", "q": "network-guided regression for detecting associations between dna methylation and gene expression"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-03-26T14:25:04Z", "channelTitle": "Centre International de Rencontres Math\u00e9matiques", "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB", "description": "Differences in disease predisposition or response to treatment can be explained in great part by genomic differences between individuals. This has given birth to precision medicine, where treatment is tailored to the genome of patients. This field depends on collecting considerable amounts of molecular data for large numbers of individuals, which is being enabled by thriving developments in genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies.\nUnfortunately, we still lack effective methods to reliably detect, from this data, which of the genomic features determine a phenotype such as disease predisposition or response to treatment. One of the major issues is that the number of features that can be measured is large (easily reaching tens of millions) with respect to the number of samples for which they can be collected (more usually of the order of hundreds or thousands), posing both computational and statistical difficulties.\nIn my talk I will discuss how to use biological networks, which allow us to understand mutations in their genomic context, to address these issues. All the methods I will present share the common hypotheses that genomic regions that are involved in a given phenotype are more likely to be connected on a given biological network than not.\n\nRecording during the meeting \"Networks and Molecuar Biology\" the March 05, 2020 at the Centre International de Rencontres Math\u00e9matiques (Marseille, France)\n\nFilmmaker: Guillaume Hennenfent\n\nFind this video and other talks given by worldwide mathematicians on CIRM's Audiovisual Mathematics Library: http://library.cirm-math.fr.

While genetic research has demonstrated that autism has a strong hereditary component, there is increasing research on the possible role of environmental exposures.\n\nOn this call hosted by CHE-Alaska, Dr. Martha Herbert of Harvard Medical School led a discussion of emerging science on how exposures to toxic chemicals may contribute to autism and other health and brain conditions. One way this can occur is through affecting physiology and brain function, starting during early development and continuing throughout the lifespan. Some chemicals that are widely used in consumer products are considered highly likely to contribute to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, yet they have not undergone even minimal assessment of potential toxicity.

Advancements in continuous microbe culturing and selection design have facilitated the development of new technologies that enable the continuous directed evolution of proteins and nucleic acids. These technologies have the potential to support the extremely rapid evolution of biomolecules with tailor-made functional properties. Continuous evolution methods must support all of the key steps of laboratory evolution \u2014 translation of genes into gene products, selection or screening, replication of genes encoding the most fit gene products, and mutation of surviving genes \u2014 in a self-sustaining manner that requires little or no researcher intervention. In this presentation, I will describe the basis and applications of our Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) platform, solutions we have devised to address known limitations in the technique, and opportunities to improve PACE where in silico computation may play a key role. Through these tools, we aspire to enable researchers to address increasingly complex biological questions and to access biomolecules with novel or even unprecedented properties.\n\nFor more information regarding the Broad Institute or Models, Inference and Algorithms visit: https://www.broadinstitute.org/mia\n\nCopyright Broad Institute, 2017.

In the first part of this lecture, I will discuss how in eukaryotic cells, the control of mRNA localization, translation and degradation in the cytoplasm allow for the proper regulation of the amount, duration, and location of protein production. The basic mechanisms of these processes are understood and reveal that the mechanisms of localization, translation, and degradation are interconnected. The unique properties of each mRNA are dictated by its intrinsic interactions with cellular machines, as well as its complement of mRNA specific RNA binding proteins and miRNAs. Strikingly, mRNPs are dynamic and can be modulated by protein modifications as well as by modification of the mRNA itself, thereby providing a diversity of targets for the regulation of mRNA function in response to extracellular signals.\n\nIn 2012, Roy Parker joined the University of Colorado, Boulder after many years at the University of Arizona.", "channelId": "UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A", "title": "Roy Parker (U.

MicroRNAs are much too short to code for protein and instead play important roles in regulating gene expression.  In humans, they regulate most protein-coding genes, including genes important in cancer and other diseases.  \n\nIn Part 1 of his talk, Bartel explains how microRNAs are made, how they have evolved, how they recognize and bind to target mRNA sequences, how this binding leads to the repression of the target mRNAs, and how this repression can be important for normal development and disease. \n\nIn Part 2, Bartel recounts experiments measuring the effect of microRNAs on mRNA levels, protein levels and protein synthesis in mammalian cells.  The results showed that almost all of the changes in protein levels and synthesis are due to changes in the amount of mRNA.  Interestingly, experiments in zebrafish embryos describe a somewhat different situation.  In the early embryo, initial decreases in protein synthesis are due to shortening of the mRNA polyA tail, which is followed later by a decrease in the amount of RNA. \n\nIn the last part of his seminar, Bartel asks how a cell knows which hairpin RNA molecules are pri-microRNAs, and should be processed into microRNAs, and which should be ignored.  He leads us through the experiments that identified some of the key conserved features of human pri-microRNAs.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nDavid Bartel studies the many roles of RNA.  His lab initially studied the ability of RNA to catalyze reactions and more recently has focused on microRNAs and other regulatory RNAs.  Since 2000, his lab has made fundamental discoveries regarding the genomics, biogenesis and regulatory targets of these RNAs, as well as the molecular and biological consequences of their actions in animals, plants and fungi.  \n\nBartel received his BA in Biology from Goshen College.  Soon after completion of his PhD at Harvard University in 1993, he joined the Whitehead Institute as a Fellow.  Currently, Bartel is Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Member of the Whitehead Institute and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  Bartel's many contributions to our understanding of the roles of RNA have been recognized with numerous awards, including the NAS Molecular Biology Award and election to the National Academy of Sciences.", "channelId": "UCsvqEZBO-kNmwuDBbKbfL6A", "title": "David Bartel (Whitehead Institute/MIT/HHMI) Part 1: MicroRNAs: Introduction to MicroRNAs", "tags": ["MicroRNA", "miRNA", "RNA hairpin", "translation"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT42M45S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1307", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "61", "viewCount": "140771", "dislikeCount": "20"}, "id": "dupzE66J8u4"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-02-15T15:50:31Z", "channelTitle": "Protein Engineering NYU Tandon", "channelId": "UCDX1CEpH2nQTWBjuphvhzDA", "title": "Week 10- Protein Engineering Lecture 10: Directed Evolution", "description": ""}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT41M56S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "39", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "2", "viewCount": "4030", "dislikeCount": "2"}, "id": "1dd5e6ys2R8"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2008-01-18T17:58:10Z", "channelTitle": "MIT OpenCourseWare", "description": "Genomics (Prof. Eric Lander)\r\n\r\nView the complete course: http://ocw.mit.edu/7-012F04\r\n\r\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\r\nMore information at http://ocw.mit.edu/terms\r\nMore courses at http://ocw.mit.edu", "channelId": "UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw", "title": "Lec 25 | MIT 7.012 Introduction to Biology, Fall 2004", "tags": ["mit", "opencourseware", "biology", "genetics", "dna", "cells", "cancer", "cloning", "immunology", "virology", "genomics", "rna", "replication"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT49M7S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "32", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "5", "viewCount": "10393", "dislikeCount": "0"}, "id": "5WhcMXP5yEU"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-09-07T01:47:42Z", "channelTitle": "Mark Temple", "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB", "description": "Introduction to the Genetic Code and Translation (protein synthesis)", "channelId": "UCYtiR9XcY0kUagbkgJW0kVg", "title": "Live Lecture 04 Genetic Code and Translation", "tags": ["Genetic Code", "Translation", "protein synthesis", "codon", "tRNAs", "tRNA", "CCA", "Wobble", "reading frame", "start codon", "stop codon", "Ribosome", "synthetase", "Shine-Dalgarno", "Elongation", "peptide bond", "Translocation"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1H22M33S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "4", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "486", "dislikeCount": "1"}, "id": "rlYaCA8yRmo"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2011-05-09T15:31:43Z", "channelTitle": "NIH VideoCast", "description": "Air date:  Wednesday, April 27, 2011, 3:00:00 PM\r\nTime displayed is Eastern Time, Washington DC Local  \r\nCategory:  Wednesday Afternoon Lectures  \r\nDescription:  The publication of the atomic structures of the 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits in 2000 revolutionized our understanding of protein synthesis.

The TATA box is not found in front of all eukaryotic genes, but is essential for strong transcription.\n\n2. The promoters for each RNA polymerase are different in structure.\n\n3. Enhancer sequence elements are DNA sequences that about bound by enhancer (transcription factor) proteins. Enhancer proteins act in this way to enhance transcription of genes located up to many thousands of base pairs upstream (ahead of), downstream (down from ) or even in the middle of genes.\n\n4. RNA Polymerase II in eukaryotes differs from RNA polymerase in E. coli in not binding to the DNA directly, but rather, it must bind to another protein that binds to the promoter first.\n\n5. In eukaryotes, rRNA is made by the action of RNA Polymerase I. It is made as a precursor and then processed, not unlike what occurs in prokaryotes.\n\n6. tRNAs in eukaryotes are made by action of RNA Polymerase III. Processing of them includes removal of a 5' leader sequence and part of a 3' tail, as well as addition of a CCA sequence at the new 3' end. The amino acid gets attached to the 3' end of the tRNA.\n\n7. Micro RNAs affect the amount of gene expression - note that the term 'gene expression' refers ultimately to the amount of functional protein made from a particular gene. Micro RNAs and silencing RNAs are made as double stranded RNAs that get processed ultimately to produce a single stranded RNA that is complementary to a target sequence in a given mRNA. When it binds to that sequence, it may result in either degradation of the mRNA or in inhibiting translation of the mRNA.\n\n8. RNA editing occurs when a base in an mRNA is altered. An example is the apoB100/apoB48 system in our bodies. apoB100 codes for a 100 kilodalton protein. An enzyme can recognize a CAA codon inside of the mRNA and deaminate the C to make it a U. That makes UAA, which is a stop codon and which stops translation, making a 48 kilodalton protein instead. Thus, the same mRNA can make two different proteins.\n\n9. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific sequences in DNA and affect transcription of the genes near them. Specifically, they bind to sequence elements.\n\n10. Eukaryotic mRNAs are significantly modified. At the 5' end, a cap is added in the form of a modified GTP that is attached in a 5' to 5' linkage to the first base of the transcript. This linkage is important for recognition, performs a role in translation, and protects agains exonuclease degradation.\n\n11. At the 3' end of eukaryotic mRNAs, a long sequence of A's is added. This too plays a role in translation and also provides a \"buffer\" against exonuclease degradation. The longer the sequence of poly-A, the longer a transcript tends to exist.\n\n12. Splicing is another modification that happens to eukaryotic mRNAs. Splicing also occurs to tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes.\n\n13. Splicing involves removal of internal sequences from RNA followed by joining of ends. The removed sequences are called introns. The segments that make it into the final RNA are called exons.\n\n14. The only sequences common to all spliced RNAs are a GU sequence at the 5' end of the intron and an AG at the 3' end of the intron. A third sequence - an A residue surrounded by pyrimidines also is common.\n\n15. Protein/RNA complexes called snRNPs mediate the splicing process in higher eukaryotes. snRNPs contain small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and proteins.\n\n16. In splicing, the hydroxyl of the A residue attacks the phosphate of the phosphodiester bond at the 5' end of the intron, creating a 5'-2' bond (part of the lariat structure). Attack by the released 3' end of the exon on the 3' end of the intron joins the two exon ends and releases the intron as a lariat.\n\n17. In splicing, the U1 snRNA forms base pairing with the 5' end of the intron sequence.\n\n18.

Replication of linear eukaryotic chromosomes is more complex than replicating the circles of prokaryotic cells. During each round of eukaryotic DNA replication, a small portion of the DNA at the end of the chromosome (known as a telomer) is lost. Telomers have thousands of copies of the same short nucleotide sequence. Telomer length may be relative the cellular lifespan.\n\n2. Telomerases are enzymes that make telomers and they are active in fetal cells. They serve to elongate the ends of linear chromosomal DNAs, adding thousands of repeats of a short sequence (junk DNA). This \"junk DNA\" is called a telomere. At each round of eukaryotic DNA replication, a short stretch at the end of the DNA is lost, shortening the telomere. The longer a telomere is, the more times a cell can divide before it starts losing important DNA sequences.\n\n3. Tumor cells are another cell type that has an active telomerase. This probably is a factor that enables them to be \"immortal\".\n\n4. Telomerase acts as a reverse transcriptase, using an RNA primer that it carries with it to copy and make the repetitive sequences of the telomer.\n\nHighlights Transcription\n\n1. Transcription is the making of RNA using DNA as a template. Transcription requires an RNA polymerase, a DNA template and 4 ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP). Transcription occurs in the 5' to 3' direction. RNA polymerases differ from DNA polymerases in the RNA polymerases do NOT require a primer.\n\n2. Transcription requires DNA strands to be opened to allow the RNA polymerase to enter and begin making RNA. Transcription starts near special DNA sequences called promoters.\n\n3.A factor known as sigma associates with the RNA polymerase in E. coli and helps it to recognize and bind to the promoter. A promoter is a sequence in DNA that is recognized by the RNA Polymerase-Sigma complex. (Note that sigma factor binds to BOTH the RNA Polymerase and to the promoter sequence in the DNA. Note also that sigma factor is a PROTEIN). Genes that are to be transcribed have a promoter close by to facilitate RNA Polymerase binding to begin transcription.\n\n4. Promoters in E. coli have two common features. The first is a sequence usually located about 10 base pairs \"upstream\" of the transcription start site (the transcription start site is the location where the first base of RNA starts). This sequence is known as the \"-10\" sequence or the Pribnow box', which is so-named because the most common version of it (known as a consensus sequence) has the sequence 5'-TATAAT-3'. The second common feature of E. coli promoters is located about 35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Eukaryotic promotoers also frequently have a TATA box, but in a slightly different position.\n\n5. Transcription occurs in three phases - initiation, elongation, and termination. Binding of RNA Polymerase and sigma is the first step in transcription (initiation). After polymerization starts, sigma factor leaves the RNA polymerase and the elongation process continues.\n\n6. The initiation phase begins with binding of transcription-related proteins to a promoter and ends when the sigma factor leaves the transcription complex - this is after about 10 nucleotides have been made into RNA.\n\n7. Termination of transcription in E. coli occurs by several mechanisms. One I discussed in class is factor independent transcription termination, which occurs as a result of a hairpin loop forming in the sequence of an RNA. When it forms, it \"lifts\" the RNA polymerase off the DNA and everything falls apart and transcription stops at that point.\n\n8. Factor dependent termination is caused by a protein called rho. Rho works by binding to the 5' end of the RNA and sliding up the RNA faster than the RNA Polymerase makes RNA. When rho catches the RNA polymerase, it causes the RNA polymerase to dissociate (come off of) the DNA and release the RNA.\n\n9. An operon is a collection of related gene sequences under the control of a single promoter. A gene is a region of DNA coding for a protein.\n\n10. The lac operon is a collection three genes in E. coli related to metabolism of the sugar lactose. It is activated when cells have access to lactose and is inactivated when lactose is absent.\n\n11. The promoter region for the lac operon contains DNA sequences that can be bound by three different proteins - CAP, RNA polymerase, and the lac repressor.\n\n12. The lac repressor binding site overlaps with the RNA polymerase binding site. When the lac repressor is bound, the RNA polymerase cannot bind and transcription cannot occur.\n\n13. CAP, on the other hand, binds to its region and helps RNA polymerase to bind, thus facilitating transcription of the operon.", "channelId": "UCEY8HU47kVeo3_Odz2w4pww", "title": "18.

Newly synthesized CBP80-CBP20 (CBC)-bound mRNPs initially undergo a pioneer round of translation (Maquat et al., 2010). One purpose of this round of translation is to ensure the quality of gene expression, as exemplified by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD largely functions to eliminate mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation, although NMD also contributes to proper gene control, and it targets CBC-bound mRNPs (for recent publications, see Sato et al., 2008; Isken et al., 2008). CBC-bound mRNPs are remodeled to eIF4E-bound mRNPs as a consequence of the pioneer round of translation as well as independently of translation, e.g., by importin-b binding to importin-a-associated CBC (Sato and Maquat, 2009). eIF4E-bound mRNPs support the bulk of cellular protein synthesis and are the primary targets of mRNA decay mechanisms that conditionally regulate gene expression, such as Staufen1-mediated mRNA decay (see, e.g., Gong et al., 2009). \r\n\r\nMechanistic aspects of NMD will be discussed, including how CBP80, which is acquired by the 5' caps of newly synthesized transcripts within nuclei, promotes NMD at multiple steps by promoting specific mRNP rearrangements (Hwang et al., 2010). Mechanistic aspects of SMD will also be described, including the formation of Staufen1-binding sites not only by intramolecular base-pairing within an mRNA 3'-untranslated region but also by intermolecular base-pairing between the Alu element of an mRNA 3-untranslated region and a partially complementary Alu element within a long noncoding RNA (Gong and Maquat, 2011). These are new functions for Alu elements and for long noncoding RNAs, which we call 1/2-sbsRNAs. \r\n\r\nThe NIH Wednesday Afternoon Lecture Series includes weekly scientific talks by some of the top researchers in the biomedical sciences worldwide. \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit: \r\nThe NIH Director's Wednesday Afternoon Lecture Series  \r\nAuthor:  Dr. Lynne Maquat, University of Rochester Center for RNA Biology  \r\nRuntime:  00:44:37  \r\nPermanent link:  http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?16747", "channelId": "UCgyzPgagPZxXM8dOAjE9B2w", "title": "Tales from the Cellular Underworld: mRNA Death Dealers", "tags": ["wals060111"]}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT44M37S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "6", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "1354", "dislikeCount": "0"}, "id": "oBg6Wpab81M"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2016-03-05T17:58:14Z", "channelTitle": "Janine LeBlanc-Straceski", "channelId": "UCysnFroTveFGEe3iDl2luqg", "title": "Unit7A Mutagenesis and Repair DNA Sequene Mutations", "description": ""}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT14M47S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "4", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "652", "dislikeCount": "0"}, "id": "WZkzsyGlxn0"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2017-11-11T05:25:44Z", "channelTitle": "Ch-09 Life Sciences, Botany, Zoology, Bio-Science", "channelId": "UCMstnunaIh21KcIpsOPtv_Q", "title": "Gene prediction", "description": "Subject :Bioinformatics\nCourse  :3rd Year / Semester V\nKeyword : SWAYAMPRABHA"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT25M21S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "49", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "1", "viewCount": "3767", "dislikeCount": "7"}, "id": "3gaV6PdLSKE"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}, {"items": [{"snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-01-29T18:57:22Z", "channelTitle": "ARC Gilroy", "channelId": "UCM0l6PlkIzvdUnC_3hPJDmw", "title": "BIOL 430 lecture 4 part 2", "description": "Protein synthesis"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT32M51S"}, "statistics": {"likeCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "66", "dislikeCount": "0"}, "id": "hnh7QheD78U"}], "idx_paper": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btu369", "q": "improving translation initiation site and stop codon recognition by using more than two classes"}]
