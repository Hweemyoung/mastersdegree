In this work, we focus on the linear correlation and non-linear dependency of different physical attributes of unsteady flows to aid their study from a new perspective. Specifically, we extend the existing spatial correlation quantification, i.e. the Local Correlation Coefficient (LCC), to the spatio-temporal domain to study the correlation of attribute-pairs from both the Eulerian and Lagrangian views. To study the dependency among attributes, which need not be linear, we extend and compute the mutual information (MI) among attributes over time. To help visualize and interpret the derived correlation and dependency among attributes associated with a particle, we encode\nthe correlation and dependency values on individual pathlines. Finally, to utilize the correlation and MI computation results to identify regions with interesting flow behavior, we propose a segmentation strategy of the flow domain based on the ranking of the strength\nof the attributes relations. We have applied our correlation and dependency metrics to a number of 2D and 3D unsteady flows with varying spatio-temporal kernel sizes to demonstrate and assess their effectiveness.", "channelId": "UCQly2ZxY-CHqwG7pO-xOy5Q", "tags": ["flow visualization", "scientific visualization", "visualization of simulation data", "data visualization"], "publishedAt": "2018-10-29T15:14:55Z", "defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "defaultLanguage": "en", "title": "Visual Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Relations of Pairwise Attributes in Unsteady Flows"}, "statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "2", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "81", "dislikeCount": "0"}}], "q": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864817", "idx_paper": "10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864817"}, {"items": [{"id": "GI8-jcr-aYE", "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT3M54S"}, "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Ervin Sejdic", "title": "Computational deglutition: Signal and image processing methods to understand swallowing disorders", "publishedAt": "2020-06-25T19:51:07Z", "description": "E.

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.\n\n\n#dysphagia #swallowing #datascience #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #engineering #medicine #SLPeeps", "channelId": "UCZTmNHUz63iphbhJc6d__JA"}, "statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "10", "dislikeCount": "0"}}], "q": "10.1109/MSP.2018.2875863", "idx_paper": "10.1109/MSP.2018.2875863"}, {"items": [{"id": "1nLVoneeCQY", "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT8M45S"}, "snippet": {"channelTitle": "Jeevan Santhara Saigaran", "title": "5G Smart Ports", "publishedAt": "2019-11-14T07:24:40Z", "description": "This is video is prepared by :\n\n1.

It has been approximated that about 15 million tons of surfactants are used a year according to Lara-Martin and others who did research on this subject in 2006. Some research done by K. Jardak and his colleges found that during the wastewater treatment process a lot of surfactants biodegrade due to oxidation during the one of the phases in the treatment process. The oxidation breaks down last carbon on the alkyl chain. The treatment process rids the wastewater of a majority of surfactants but not all, this is where the concern about the environmental effects comes from due to the fact that is a relatively small input into the environment but it is a consistent one.\n Jardak and his team also go into describing the two main types of surfactants anionic and nonionic surfactants. Anionic surfactants are the most common due to their cheap manufacturing cost and the ease at which they are absorbed into solids when in water. They cited one group of concern in the anionic surfactant class are perfluorooctanoic (PFO) which are used in shampoos and nonstick pans. PFO chemicals make are different than the ones in you dish soap due to the need for the protection against heat solubility in water. These types of surfactants are not biodegradable and need to be taken out in the water treatment process because they do bio accumulate like the heavy metal mercury. The reason for this state by Jardak is the bonds compared to the common anionic surfactant (alkylbenzene sulfonates) which has a carbon hydrogen bond PFOS have some fluorine carbon bonds which are a lot stronger. Nonionic surfactants are less common and are used usually in a mixture with other surfactants main for industrial use. On the contrary these nonionic surfactants have more restrictions because compared to anionic surfactants they do not break down well in the natural environment. Jardak further explains that when nonionic surfactants partially break down, they leave behind nonylphenol and octylphenol which are toxic to humans and aquatic life. Jardak and his team found that overall the effects of surfactants have physically on aquatic life create gill damage and decrease mobility of fish too decreased respiration and excess mucus build up along with causing skin irritation and sometimes allegories with humans. In other studies, Markowski and a group of scientists found that a presence of surfactants in water bodies can increase eutrophication because it inhibits oxygens ability to move deeper away from the surface. This causes more issues with dead zones forming and decreasing the area in which algae and fish can survive. On the cellular level surfactants cause depolarization of cells membrane causing decreased absorption and expulsion inhibiting the health of the organisms made clear by Jardak and his team.\n For mitigation purposes the most obvious answer is to swing away from using the surfactants that don\u2019t biodegrade vary easily and stick around in soil for centuries causing accumulation problems. We could also try and avoid and update cities waste disposal systems where untreated water does not enter water bodies along with improving wastewater treatment plants to improve the retention rate of surfactants in the waste sludge. \n\nSources: \nPalmer M, Hatley H.

This game offers us a safe haven from stress, opportunities to feel strong, powerful, and in control. Doom is perfect for stress-reduction and an oasis away from emotional labor for the emotional exhausted. The trick to getting all this out of a game is learning to treat games and other media encounters more seriously and to monitor our emotions and moods as we play. \n\n____________________________\n\nRead More at the Website: screentherapyblog.wordpress.com \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/screen_therapy\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/screentherapy/\n\n------------------------------\n\nGames:  \n\nDOOM (1993) by id Software\nDOOM (2016) by id Software\nDOOM: Eternal (2020) by id Software\n-----------------------------\n\nSources in Order:\nMihaly Csikszentmih\u00e1lyi (1990).

Is this limited to heavy users, Recreational users, medicinal cannabis patients? In this episode, FPS ventures into the unknown on the very under-researched area of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. In this episode neuroscience PhD candidate Marieka Devuono joins us to speak about her recently published manuscript that addresses these controversial concepts, entitled \"Conditioned gaping produced by high dose \u03949-tetrahydracannabinol: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic endocannabinoid system\", published in Neurophamacology [2018 Oct;141:272-282. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.08.039]. \nLink: https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028-3908(18)30598-7\n\nHighlights\n\u2022  High doses of THC produce nausea-induced conditioned gaping.\n\u2022 THC-induced conditioned gaping was mediated by its action on the CB1 receptor.\n\u2022 10\u202fmg/kg THC produced upregulation of genes related to the 2-AG degrading enzyme, MAGL in the hypothalamus.\n\u2022 High doses of THC may produce stress-induced nausea by dysregulation of endocannabinoid function in the hypothalamus.\n\nAbstract\n\u03949-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) is recognized as an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting via its action on the cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor. Paradoxically, there is evidence that THC can also produce nausea and vomiting. Using the conditioned gaping model of nausea in rats, we evaluated the ability of several doses of THC (0.0, 0.5, 5 and 10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) to produced conditioned gaping reactions. We then investigated the ability of the CB1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, to block the establishment of THC-induced conditioned gaping. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was then used to investigate changes in endocannabinoid related genes in various brain regions in rats chronically treated with vehicle (VEH), 0.5 or 10\u202fmg/kg THC. THC produced dose-dependent gaping, with 5 and 10\u202fmg/kg producing significantly more gaping reactions than VEH or 0.5\u202fmg/kg THC, a dose known to have anti-emetic properties. Pre-treatment with rimonabant reversed this effect, indicating that THC-induced conditioned gaping was CB1 receptor mediated. The RT-PCR analysis revealed an upregulation of genes for the degrading enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidolyl glycerol (2-AG), in the hypothalamus of rats treated with 10\u202fmg/kg THC. No changes in the expression of relevant genes were found in nausea (interoceptive insular cortex) or vomiting (dorsal vagal complex) related brain regions. These findings support the hypothesis that THC-induced nausea is a result of a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to an overactive stress response.\n\nKeywords\nTHC Conditioned gaping Endocannabinoid system Hypothalamus Nausea.\n\n\nUse Filmora To Create Great Quality Videos - 20% off Link: http://tiny.cc/b86pkz \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nInterested in cutting-edge neuroscience research?

Using Cl and Br K-edge XANES spectroscopy, we have measured high concentrations of organo-chlorine and -bromine in naturally degraded particulate organic matter (POM) from oceanic sedi-ment traps. While organobromine speciation in marine POM is exclusively aromatic, organochlorine is fractionated into aliphatic and aromatic particles that appear in a heterogeneous distribution. The major precursor of sediment trap material is phytoplankton biomass, the detritus of which under-goes oxidative breakdown as part of the marine carbon cycle. We hypothesized that unsaturated lipid and protein moieties in phytoplankton detritus would be susceptible to halogenation through oxidative degradation mechanisms. Using model experiments, we showed that algal particulates are readily chlorinated and brominated through various abiotic pathways, including photochemical and Fenton-like reactions. These processes produce organohalogens in particulate algal detritus at levels exceeding 0.1% by mass. In contrast with the exclusively aromatic organobromine observed in nat-ural marine POM, the lab-based experiments generate aliphatic organobromine in algal particulates; however, the aliphatic organobromine produced appears to be labile and susceptible to debromina-tion on relatively short (3-week) timescales under highly oxidizing conditions. These findings have implications for the transformation and stabilization of marine organic carbon prior to sedimentary burial.\nWe have also measured high concentrations of non-volatile organochlorine and -bromine in several varieties of edible kelps. Such compounds are likely to contribute to organohalogen body burden in humans and other organisms.\nReading: \"A. Leri, M. Dunigan, R. Wenrich, and B. Ravel (2019).

Martina K\u00f6lbl-Ebert et al (2018), Current Biology https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.09.013\n\nPycnodontiformes are an extinct order of ray-finned fishes from the Triassic to Eocene, with a characteristic crushing dentition reflecting a highly specialized diet. However, our discovery of a new pycnodontiform from the Late Jurassic (ca. 152 Ma) Plattenkalk deposits of the Solnhofen Archipelago revealed long, pointed teeth along the vomer and triangular teeth with cutting edges along the prearticulars.\n\nThis is the earliest evidence of specialized flesh cutting in a ray-finned fish. The dentition pattern, tooth shape, jaw morphology, and mechanics are all indicative of a feeding apparatus suitable for slicing flesh or fins, thus pioneering a new ecological niche.\n\nEvidence suggests that it may have exploited aggressive mimicry in a striking parallel to the feeding patterns of modern piranha. Remarkably, fossil fishes recovered from the same deposits as the new pycnodontiform show injuries to fins and fin bases. As a marine piranha-like fish contemporary with dinosaurs, it is the oldest known flesh-eating actinopterygian, revealing remarkable convergent evolution with modern piranhas.\n\nGood channel: https://www.youtube.com/Dlium\nSubscribe, like and comment.\n\nGood website: https://www.dlium.com\nBookmark, subscribe and comment.", "channelId": "UC32BboXfQ_tDCV8y1ttx7cg", "tags": ["Current Biology", "Pycnodontiformes", "Piranhamesodon", "Late Jurassic", "Solnhofen Archipelago", "piranha-like dentition", "convergent evolution", "functional morphology", "marine fishes", "predation"], "publishedAt": "2018-10-19T21:33:57Z", "defaultAudioLanguage": "en", "title": "A Piranha-like Pycnodontiform Fish from the Late Jurassic"}, "statistics": {"favoriteCount": "0", "likeCount": "1", "commentCount": "0", "viewCount": "36", "dislikeCount": "0"}}], "q": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.09.013", "idx_paper": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.09.013"}, {"items": [{"id": "U4pFLXKn6so", "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT2M41S"}, "snippet": {"channelTitle": "lee erlinda", "description": "https://rebrand.ly/Goldco1     \nGet More Info Now\n\nGetting The Precious Metals - Jewelry Education - Occasions Fine Jewelry To Work\n\n\n\nAs a stunt to publicise the 99.999% pure one-ounce Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, in 2007 the Royal Canadian Mint made a 100 kg 99.999% gold coin, with a face value of $1 million, and now makes them to order, but at a substantial premium over the market worth of the gold.\n\nSilver coins have ended up being popular with collectors due to their relative price, and, unlike most gold and platinum issues which are valued based upon the marketplaces, silver issues are regularly valued as collectibles, far greater than their real bullion worth.
