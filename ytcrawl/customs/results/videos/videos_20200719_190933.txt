When you get a cut, little messengers in your hand called neurons, that are all over your body, send a message to the brain, telling it that your hand was cut. Your brain receives the message, and now knows where the cut is and how much it hurts, ow! This feeling is what pain is, and might make you cry.\n\n13 year old - Aaya Shatila:\nWhen your body gets injured, your neurons send millions of messages to your brain about what\u2019s going on. Neurons consist of dendrites, cell bodies, and axons. The message that is now an electrical signal is received by the dendrites, added up by the cell body, and propagated down the neuron by the axon, eventually making it to the spine. The first neuron sends that electrical signal to another neuron through messenger molecules called neurotransmitters. The second neuron sends the signal to the brain. The brain further processes that signal in a special location, allowing us to sense pain.\n\nCollege - Cameron Haghshenas:\nWhen you receive noxious stimuli from an external source your nociceptors, specialized neurons, are stimulated. Depending on the stimulus, there are different kinds of nociceptors such as mechanical, thermal, or chemical that respond to pain, heat, and certain molecules respectively.  The now electrical signal, if the graded potential passes a certain threshold and becomes an action potential is then propagated down the peripheral nerve, eventually synapsing with a dorsal root ganglion/secondary neuron in the spinal cord of the central nervous system. Neurotransmitter Substance P is released from the primary, pre-synaptic neuron into the CNS where the secondary, post-synaptic neuron can then take it up via its dendrites. That secondary neuron decussates across the spinal cord via the spinothalamic tract and synapses in the thalamus. The thalamus, acting as the relay station of the brain, sends the appropriate signal via a third order neuron to the appropriate place in the somatosensory cortex. This is what allows us to perceive the painful sensation and pinpoint kinetically where it is occurring.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438523/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10967/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964977/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21535/\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003439\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/15/10/1669/1939615\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228136/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507824/\n\nhttp://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/5/1543\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904790/\n\nBIPN 152- The Healthy and Diseased Brain- Shelley Halpain, Spring 2019, UCSD\n\nSong: Location - Khalid\n\nGroup Members\nAaya Shatila\nTzu-Hsuan Chen\nCameron Haghshenas", "channelId": "UCntZGAiUlxLj2DXx9HwtcVQ", "publishedAt": "2019-05-28T19:55:34Z", "title": "Neuro3L | What is Pain?

Is there a leader, or is decision-making based on an egalitarian system? Is leadership related to social dominance status? We collected GPS trajectory data from an owner and her six dogs during several walks. We found that dogs adjusted their trajectories to that of the owner, that they periodically run away, then turn back and return to her in a loop. Tracks have unique features characterising individual dogs. Leading roles among the dogs are frequently interchanged, but leadership is consistent on a long timescale. Decisions about running away and turning back to the owner are not based on an egalitarian system; instead, leader dogs exert a disproportionate influence on the movement of the group. Leadership during walks is related to the dominance rank assessed in everyday agonistic situations; thus, the collective motion of a dog group is influenced by the underlying hierarchical social network. Leader/dominant dogs have a unique personality: they are more trainable, controllable, and aggressive, additionally they are older than follower/subordinate dogs. Dogs are an ideal model for understanding human social behaviour. Therefore, we address the possibility of conducting similar studies in humans, e.g. walking with children and detecting interactions between individuals.\nPaper: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003446", "channelId": "UCbOc2RASuQAwrM7R1cqI4Uw", "title": "Leadership are linked to dominance order and individual traits in dogs", "channelTitle": "FamilyDogProject", "tags": ["dog", "canine", "science", "research", "Department of Ethology", "cognition", "wolf", "wolves", "puppy", "gps", "vizsla", "dog group", "personality", "dominance"], "publishedAt": "2018-04-10T15:56:52Z"}, "id": "KgnpX9dd_WM", "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT1M39S"}}], "idx_paper": "10.1109/TVT.2013.2270315", "q": "journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003446"}]
